The aim of this study was to determine the expression of POSTN in the cells of non-invasive ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and to correlate it with clinicopathological data Immunohistochemical studies (IHC) were conducted on 21 cases of fibrocystic breast change (FC), 44 cases of DCIS and 92 cases of IDC. POSTN expression at mRNA (real-time PCR) and protein level (western blot analysis) was also confirmed in selected breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231 and BO2). Statistically significant higher level of POSTN expression in IDC and DCIS cancer cells compared to FC was noted. Also, the level of POSTN expression in the cytoplasm of IDC cells was shown to increase with the increasing degree of tumour malignancy (G) and significantly higher expression of POSTN was observed in each degree of tumour malignancy (G) relative to FC. Statistically significant higher POSTN expression was observed in tumours with estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) and progesterone receptor-negative (PR-) phenotypes in comparison to estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and progesterone receptor-positive (PR+) cases, as well as significant negative correlation between POSTN expression in cancer cells and expression of ER and PR (p<0.05). Additionally, statistically significant differences in POSTN expression were shown between particular breast cancer cell lines, both at mRNA and protein level. Observed POSTN expression was the lowest in the case of MCF-7, and the highest in MDA-MB-231 and BO2 of the most aggressive potential clinically corresponding to G3 tumours. POSTN expression in the cytoplasm of IDC cancer cells may play an important role in cancer transformation mechanism.

Tpm4.1 expression is down-regulated in a subset of breast cancer cells compared with untransformed MCF10A breast epithelial cells and in highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines derived from poorly metastatic MDA-MD-231 cells. In addition, patients with invasive ductal breast carcinoma show decreased TPM4 expression compared with patients with ductal breast carcinoma in situ, and low TPM4 expression is associated with poor prognosis. Loss of Tpm4.1 using siRNA in MCF10A cells increases cell migration in wound-healing and Boyden chamber assays and invasion out of spheroids as well as disruption of cell-cell adhesions. Down-regulation of Tpm4.1 in MDA-MB-231 cells leads to disruption of actin organization and increased cell invasion and dissemination from spheroids into collagen gels. The down-regulation of Tpm4.1 induces Rac1-mediated alteration of myosin IIB localization, and pharmacologic inhibition of Rac1 or down-regulation of myosin IIB using siRNA inhibits the invasive phenotypes in MCF10A cells. Thus Tpm4.1 plays an important role in blocking invasive behaviors through Rac1-myosin IIB signaling and our findings suggest that decreased expression of Tpm4.1 might play a crucial role during tumor progression.														1949-2553	1949-2553	10.18632/oncotarget.16825																		J	BCI:BCI201700343773	28190250			Plasma carotenoids and the risk of premalignant breast disease in women aged 50 and younger: a nested case-control study		Cohen, Kevin; Liu, Ying; Luo, Jingqin; Appleton, Catherine M.; Colditz, Graham A.

The analysis included 147 participants diagnosed with benign breast disease or breast carcinoma in situ during a 27-month follow-up and 293 controls. Cases and controls were matched on age, race/ethnicity, and date of and fasting status at blood draw. Plasma carotenoids were quantified. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and linear regression to assess racial differences in plasma carotenoids.The risk reduction between the highest and lowest tertiles varied by carotenoid, with beta-cryptoxanthin having the greatest reduction (OR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.62-1.09; P (trend) = 0.056) and total carotenoids the least (OR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.48-1.44; P (trend) = 0.12). We observed an inverse association between plasma carotenoids and risk of PBD in obese women (BMI ae<yen> 30 kg/m(2); 61 cases and 115 controls) but not lean women (BMI < 25 kg/m(2); 54 cases and 79 controls), although the interaction was not statistically significant. Compared to white women, black women had lower levels of alpha and beta-carotene and higher levels of beta-cryptoxanthin and lutein/zeaxanthin.We observed suggestive inverse associations between plasma carotenoids and risk of PBD in younger women, consistent with inverse associations reported for invasive breast cancer. Carotenoids may play a role early in breast cancer development.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-017-4152-5																		J	BCI:BCI201700375082				Claudin-4 expression is associated with disease free survival in breast carcinoma in situ: Mean follow up of 8.2 years		Duarte, G.

Compared with the hormone receptor (HoR)+/HER-subgroup, patients with triple negative (TN) breast cancer were more likely to have tumors that were higher in grade and larger in size; they were also more likely to have tumors with ductal and comedo histology and were less likely to have tumors with cribriform and papillary histology (each P < 0.05). During the follow-up period, patients with TN breast cancer had an OS of 97.0% compared with 98.6 % in the HoR+/HER-subgroup (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the BCSM rate was 1.0% for the TN group compared with 0.1% for the HoR+/HER-subgroup (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with TN MBC had a poorer OS and BCSM (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis of OS with respect to the local treatment history showed that patients who received breast-conserving surgery (BCS) combined with radiotherapy (R) were more likely to have an improved OS (P < 0.05). Moreover, the results demonstrated that patients who underwent SLNB were more likely to have a lower BCSM (P < 0.05).Conclusions: The results demonstrate that BCIS appears to alter the prognosis associated with the TN subtype. Meanwhile, BCS plus R was a preferable option and resulted in survival rates that were better than those achieved with mastectomy; thus, SLNB should be considered as an appropriate assessment of axillary staging in patients with BCIS.														1949-2553	1949-2553	10.18632/oncotarget.13785																		J	BCI:BCI201700827149				Differential distribution of immune cells in breast invasive carcinoma vs. breast carcinoma in situ and its significance in interpretation of immune surveillance		Wang, Li; Qin, Jun-Hui; Liang, Yuan; Yu, Ying-Hao; Cho, William C.

On one hand, in spite of extensive studies, there is no cancer specific antigens identified. Yet, the organisms do exert immune response to tumors. On the other hand, it is believed that immune surveillance suppresses tumorigenesis by eradicating mutated cells. However, it is also widely known that tumorigenesis is promoted by inflammation, which is in nature immune reaction. In the present study, we tried to find immune cells in early tumor lesions for the supportive or negative evidence of immune surveillance. We used immunohistochemistry to observe the localization and distribution of immune cells in the in situ carcinoma lesions and in the invasive cancer of breast. Interestingly, we did not see immune cells in either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) of breast, the two basic supposed early cancer forms. In contrast, we observed extensive infiltration of immune cells in the invasive breast cancer, and close contact between immune cells and tumor cells. Based on these findings, we propose that the tumor antigens of breast cancer are not derived from the gene mutation or amplification such as HER2, but rather from misplacement of epithelial cells in the mesenchymal tissue. To avoid being targeted by the immune system, the carcinoma cells exert epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Therefore, immunosurveillance could be regarded as preventing the intrusion of epithelial cells to mesenchymal tissues, and EMT is a form of immune escape by the strategy of mimicry.														1936-2625	1936-2625																			J	BCI:BCI201600773979	26876209			Loss of MLCK leads to dleisruption of cell-cell adhesion and invasive behavior of breast epithelial cells via increased expression of EGFR and ERK/JNK signaling		Kim, D.

(dhelfman@kaist.ac.kr)									Oncogene		2016	AUG 2016	35	34	4495-4508	4495	4508							Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) expression is downregulated in breast cancer, including invasive ductal carcinoma compared with ductal breast carcinoma in situ and metastatic breast tumors. However, little is known about how loss of MLCK expression contributes to tumor progression. MLCK is a component of the actin cytoskeleton and its known role is the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin II. To gain insights into the role of MLCK in breast cancer, we perturbed its function using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or pharmacological inhibition in untransformed breast epithelial cells (MCF10A). Loss of MLCK by siRNAs led to increased cell migration and invasion, disruption of cell-cell adhesions and enhanced formation of focal adhesions at the leading edge of migratory cells. In addition, downregulation of MLCK cooperated with HER2 in MCF10A cells to promote cell migration and invasion and low levels of MLCK is associated with a poor prognosis in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Associated with these altered migratory behaviors were increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways in MLCK downregulated MCF10A cells. By contrast, inhibition of the kinase function of MLCK using pharmacological agents inhibited cell migration and invasion, and did not affect cellular adhesions. Our results show that loss of MLCK contributes to the migratory properties of epithelial cells resulting from changes in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions, and increased epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. These findings suggest that decreased expression of MLCK may have a critical role during tumor progression by facilitating the metastatic potential of tumor cells.														0950-9232	1476-5594	10.1038/onc.2015.508																		J	BCI:BCI201700452351				Down-regulation of a high molecular weight tropomyosin Tpm4.1 leads to disruption of cell-cell adhesions and invasive behavior in breast epithelial cells.

Gallbladder toxicity led to B-29 discontinuation of OCT, and MA.14 OCT administration shortened to 2 years. Median follow-up was 9.8 years for 667 MA.14 patients and 6.8 years for 893 B-29 patients. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), defined as time from randomization to time of breast cancer recurrence; second primary cancer other than squamous or basal cell skin carcinoma, cervical carcinoma in situ, or lobular breast carcinoma in situ; or death. The primary statistical test was a univariable pooled stratified log-rank test; multivariable assessment was with Cox regression. For MA.14, 97 % of patients were a parts per thousand yen50 years; for B-29, 62 %. MA.14 patients were 53 % lymph node negative (LN-) while B-29 were 100 % LN-; 33 % of MA.14 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, 2 % concurrently, while B-29 had 53 % concurrent chemotherapy. MA.14 patients were 90% hormone receptor positive; B-29, 100 %. MA.14 patients experienced 5-year DFS of 80 % with TAM, 76 % with TAM + OCT; B-29 patients had 5-year DFS of 88 % for both arms. Pooled univariable TAM + OCT to TAM hazard ratio (HR) was 0.99 (95% CI 0.81-1.20; p = 0.69): for MA.14, HR = 0.94 (0.73-1.20; p = 0.50); for B-29, HR = 1.09 (0.80-1.50; p = 0.59). Multivariable pooled HR = 0.98 (0.81-1.20; p = 0.84). Older patients (p < 0.001), with higher T stage (p < 0.001), and LN + (p < 0.001) had shorter DFS. Addition of OCT to TAM did not significantly improve DFS; gallbladder toxicity shortened the additional administration of OCT. This does not negate targeting the insulin-IGF-I receptor family with less toxic therapeutics.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-015-3547-4																		J	BCI:BCI201500592160	26121683			Expression of Notch1 Correlates with Breast Cancer Progression and Prognosis		Yuan, Xun; Zhang, Mingsheng; Wu, Hua; Xu, Hanxiao; Han, Na; Chu, Qian; Yu, Shiying; Chen, Yuan; Wu, Kongming (kmwu@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn)									PLoS One		2015	JUN 29 2015	10	6	Article No.: e0131689	e0131689								Various studies have evaluated the significance of Notch1 expression in breast cancer, but the results have ever been disputed. By using 21 studies involving 3867 patients, this meta-analysis revealed that the expression of Notch1 was significantly higher in breast cancer than in normal tissues (OR=7.21; 95% CI, 4.7-11.07) and that higher Notch1 expression was associated with transition from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive cancer (OR=3.75; 95% CI, 1.8-7.78). Higher Notch1 activity was observed in the basal subtype of breast cancer (OR=2.53; 95% CI, 1.18-5.43). Moreover, patients with Notch1 overexpression exhibited significantly worse overall and recurrence-free survival. Our meta-analysis suggests that Notch inhibitors may be useful in blocking the early progression of DCIS and that the outcomes of clinical trials for Notch1-targeting therapeutics could be improved by the molecular stratification of breast cancer patients.

All the studies were published prior to Mar. 21, 2014. The studies published in English or Chinese were collected. A total of 11 studies, including 1,408 breast lesions from 1,245 women, were analyzed. The values of summary sensitivity and summary specificity were 0.843 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.811-0.872) and 0.932 (95% CI: 0.913-0.948) for VTQ of ARFI, and 0.864 (95% CI: 0.799-0.914) and 0.882 (95% CI: 0.832-0.922) for VTI of ARFI, respectively. Subgroup analysis excluding mucinous carcinoma and carcinoma in situ showed higher summary sensitivity (0.877 95% CI: 0.835-0.911), higher summary specificity (0.943 95% CI: 0.921-0.960) and lower heterogeneity (I-2=23.5%). The cut-off values for shear wave velocity of VTQ ranged widely from 2.89 to 6.71 m/s, while the VTI ranged narrowly from 1.37 to 1.66. In general, ARFI elastography seems to be a good method for differentiation between benign and malignant breast lesions. However, its usefulness for identifying breast mucinous carcinoma and breast carcinoma in situ is limited. VTI seems to be more reliable and repeatable than VTQ.														1940-5901																				J	BCI:BCI201500108234	25227964			Re-resection rates and risk characteristics following breast conserving surgery for breast cancer and carcinoma in situ: A single-centre study of 1575 consecutive cases		Kryh, C.

However, its expression and function in human malignant tumors are largely unknown. Here, we present our study investigating Armc8 expression in tumor and non-tumor breast tissues including 45 normal epithelia, 53 lesions of hyperplasia with or without dysplasia, 22 benign tumors, and 92 carcinomas including 28 carcinomas in situ and 64 infiltrating carcinomas using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting study. Armc8 expression was detected mainly in the cytoplasm with occasional membrane immunostaining. The positive rate of Armc8 expression in normal breast epithelia (8.9 %, four out of 45) was very low. No significant difference was found between Armc8 expression in usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH) (11.1 %, two out of 18), benign breast tumors including intraductal papilloma (10.0 %, one out of 10) and fibroadenoma (8.3 %, one out of 12), and normal breast epithelia (p > 0.05). Elevated expression of Armc8 was found in breast epithelia with dysplasia (24.0 %, six out of 25) compared to that in normal breast epithelia, UDH, and benign breast tumors (p < 0.05). Armc8 expression in breast carcinoma including breast carcinoma in situ (10/28, 35.7 %), infiltrating ductal carcinoma (60.7 %, 34/56), and infiltrating lobular carcinoma (50.0 %, 4/8) was higher than that in normal breast epithelia, UDH, benign breast tumors, and breast epithelia with dysplasia (p < 0.05). The highest expression of Armc8 was found in infiltrating breast carcinoma (59.4 %, 38/64) compared to all the other breast tissues. Higher Armc8 expression was found to be linked to lymph node metastasis and advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages (III + IV) in infiltrating breast carcinoma (p < 0.05). We further confirmed Armc8 expression in breast epithelial cell line MCF10A and breast carcinoma cell lines including MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and ZR751 using Western blotting and immunofluorescent study.

Human ortholog of mammalian enabled (hMena), a family of enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoproteins (Ena/VASP), is an actin regulatory protein involved in the regulation of cell motility. hMena has been shown to have several splice variants, including the hMena(INV) isoform, expressed in invasive cancer cells, and the epithelial-specific isoform, hMena(11a). We assessed the relative mRNA expression of hMena splice variants in 50 cases of invasive ductal breast carcinoma of no special type (IDC-NST) and 45 cases of ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with special reference to non-neoplastic breast epithelial tissues. The samples were dissected from their respective regions by laser microdissection. Our results confirmed previous reports that hMena(INV) expression is augmented during tumor progression, while hMena(11a) is downregulated. Furthermore, simultaneous expression of hMena(11a) and hMena(INV) was found only in malignant lesions, while their expression was hardly detected in normal breast tissue and benign proliferative breast lesions. These results indicate that the higher relative expression of hMena(11a) compared with hMena(INV) may predict malignant transformation in breast epithelial cells, and, furthermore, a reversal of expression of hMena(11a) and hMena(INV) may dictate the state of cancer progression. Here, we demonstrate that determination of hMenalla and hMena' expression could be a useful biomarker for predicting malignant behavior in breast epithelial lesions, and show that their relative expression is linked to adverse prognostic factors. Although the biological activity of the majority of alternatively spliced isoforms and their contribution to cancer biology has yet to be determined, their elucidation will have a large impact on therapeutic strategies for cancer.														1019-6439	1791-2423	10.3892/ijo.2014.2591																		J	BCI:BCI201400681146	25203208			The CDC42-Interacting Protein 4 Controls Epithelial Cell Cohesion and Tumor Dissemination		Rolland, Yanneve; Marighetti, Paola; Malinverno, Chiara; Confalonieri, Stefano; Luise, Chiara; Ducano, Nadia; Palamidessi, Andrea; Bisi, Sara; Kajiho, Hiroaki; Troglio, Flavia; Shcherbakova, Olga G.; Dunn, Alexander R.; Oldani, Amanda; Lanzetti, Letizia; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo; Disanza, Andrea (andrea.disanza@ifom.eu) ; Scita, Giorgio (giorgio.scita@ifom.eu)									Developmental Cell		2014	SEP 8 2014	30	5	553-568	553	568							The role of endocytic proteins and the molecular mechanisms underlying epithelial cell cohesion and tumor dissemination are not well understood. Here, we report that the endocytic F-BAR-containing CDC42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4) is required for ERBB2-and TGF-beta 1-induced cell scattering, breast cancer (BC) cell motility and invasion into 3D matrices, and conversion from ductal breast carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma in mouse xenograft models. CIP4 promotes the formation of an E-cadherin-CIP4-SRC complex that controls SRC activation, E-cadherin endocytosis, and localized phosphorylation of the myosin light chain kinase, thereby impinging on the actomyosin contractility required to generate tangential forces to break cell-cell junctions. CIP4 is upregulated in ERBB2-positive human BC, correlates with increased distant metastasis, and is an independent predictor of poor disease outcome in subsets of BC patients. Thus, it critically controls cell-cell cohesion and is required for the acquisition of an invasive phenotype in breast tumors.

In situ hybridization was performed on cell block sections from 18 of the collected cases, on both the Ventana BenchMark ULTRA and the Ventana BenchMark XT, and the HER2/neu gene amplification status was determined. This was then compared to the HER2/neu status by IHC and/or FISH in the resection specimen or previous biopsy specimen.Results.-Comparison of HER2/neu status by ISH on the quantifiable cell block sections showed 100% correlation with the HER2/neu status determined by IHC or FISH in the corresponding histologic specimens. The results from thrombin and formalin cell blocks were statistically superior to the results from Cellient cell blocks on both Ventana instruments.Conclusions.-While further validation and study are needed, preliminary results show that the HER2/neu gene amplification status of breast carcinomas can reliably be determined on thrombin and formalin cell block material by using ISH. More consistent staining and better signal integrity was obtained with the Ventana BenchMark ULTRA than the BenchMark XT.														0003-9985	1543-2165	10.5858/arpa.2013-0314-SA																		J	BCI:BCI201400580918	24966968			Diagnostic utility of E-cadherin and P120 catenin cocktail immunostain in distinguishing DCIS from LCIS		Li, Xiaoxian (xli40@emory.edu) ; Schwartz, Mary R.; Ro, Jae; Hamilton, Candice R.; Ayala, Alberto G.; Truong, Luan D.; Zhai, Qihui ''Jim'' (zhai.qihui@mayo.edu)									International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Pathology		2014		7	5	2551-2557	2551	2557							Background: Breast carcinoma in situ (CIS) is classified into ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). DCIS is treated with surgical excision while LCIS can be clinically followed with or without hormonal treatment. Thus, it is critical to distinguish DCIS from LCIS. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for E-cadherin is routinely used to differentiate DCIS from LCIS in diagnostically challenging cases. Circumferential diffuse membranous staining of E-cadherin is the typical pattern in DCIS, whereas LCIS lacks or shows decreased E-cadherin expression. Recent studies have shown that DCIS has membranous staining of P120 catenin and LCIS has diffuse cytoplasmic staining of P120 catenin. We developed a cocktail composed of E-cadherin and P120 catenin primary antibodies so that only one slide is needed for the double immunostains. Designs: Twenty-seven blocks of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from 26 cases of DCIS or LCIS were retrieved from the archives of Houston Methodist Hospital. Four consecutive sections from the same blocks were used for H&E and immunohistochemical (IHC) stains. The E-cadherin antibody was a rabbit polyclonal antibody and the P120 catenin antibody was a mouse monoclonal antibody. The E-cadherin primary antibody was detected using a secondary antibody raised against rabbit antibody and was visualized with a brown color. The P120 catenin primary antibody was detected using a secondary antibody raised against mouse antibody and was visualized with a red color. Results: Using individual antibodies, 15 of 15 DCIS lesions had diffuse circumferential membranous E-cadherin staining (brown stain) or P120 catenin staining (red stain). All 12 LCIS cases showed cytoplasmic P120 red staining or loss of E-cadherin staining when the single P120 catenin or E-cadherin antibody was used. When stained with the antibody cocktail, all 15 DCIS samples showed diffuse red and brown membranous staining without cytoplasmic stain; all 12 LCIS samples showed diffuse cytoplasmic red staining for P120 catenin but no membranous staining for E-cadherin. Conclusions: 1. This antibody cocktail can be applied in daily practice on paraffin-embedded tissue and is especially useful in small biopsies with small foci of CIS lesions. 2. Immunohistochemical staining with the antibody cocktail showed 100% concordance with the traditional single antibody immunostaining using either E-cadherin or P120 catenin antibody. 3. Our antibody cocktail includes E-cadherin as a positive membranous stain for DCIS and P120 catenin as a positive cytoplasmic stain for LCIS, which may enhance accuracy and confidence in the differential diagnoses.														1936-2625	1936-2625																			J	BCI:BCI201300257839				Classification of Recurrent MAST and NOTCH Mutations in Breast Carcinoma, a Study of Pre-Malignant Lesions Indicates Early Involvement		Clay, M.

Detailed information on different types of physical activity conducted during the prior year, such as occupational, recreational, and household activity, as well as on important cofactors, was assessed at baseline. Adjusted HRs for in situ breast cancer were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models.Results: During a median follow-up period of 11.7 years, 1,059 incidents of breast carcinoma in situ were identified, in crude and adjusted multivariable models, no associations were found for occupational, household, and recreational physical activity. Furthermore, total physical activity was not associated with risk of in situ breast cancer. Comparing moderately inactive, moderately active, and active participants with inactive study participants resulted in adjusted HRs of 0.99 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.83-1.19], 0.99 (95% CI, 0.82-1.20), and 1.07(95% CI, 0.81-1.40), respectively (P value of trend test: 0.788). No inverse associations were found in any substrata defined by age at diagnosis or body mass index (BMI) status.Conclusions: In this large prospective study, we did not find any evidence of an association between physical activity and in situ breast cancer risk. It not by chance, the contrast between our results for carcinoma in situ and the recognized inverse association for invasive breast cancer suggests that physical activity may have stronger effects on proliferation and late stage carcinogenesis.

(elizabeth.claus@yale.edu)									Cancer Epidemiology		2012	APR 2012	36	2	161-168	161	168							Background and aim: The relationship between hormone therapy (HT) and invasive breast cancer has been extensively investigated, but the relationship between HT and in situ breast cancer has received relatively little attention. We examined the relationship between HT and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) among postmenopausal women who participated in a population-based case-control study in Connecticut, USA. Methods: This analysis included 1179 post-menopausal women (603 controls and 576 cases), who comprised a subset of a population-based case-control study that included all incident cases of breast carcinoma in situ (BCIS) in Connecticut and frequency-matched controls by 5-year age intervals. Results: We found no association between DCIS and ever use of any HT (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65-1.11); of estrogen alone (adjusted OR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.68-1.29) or of estrogen and progesterone (adjusted OR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.52-1.08). There was also no association between DCIS and current use of these hormones. In addition, estimated risk of DCIS did not increase with duration of use of these preparations. Conclusions: These results add to a small literature that remains inconclusive. To determine whether HT poses risk of in situ breast cancer, larger studies with greater power and precise control of important covariates (e. g., mammography screening) are needed, as are meta-analyses of available data.

Methods: 3,586 asymptomatic women (mean age, 45.3 years) were retrospectively analyzed by breast MRI followed by US. US-guided biopsy was performed when the MRI-detected lesion was confirmed by US. When the lesion was not detected on the initial US, a second-look US guided by MRI findings was performed. Then biopsy was done. MRI-positive and US-negative patients were followed up according to MRI lesion size, MRI lesion morphology, and mammographic diagnosis. Results: In total, 115 subjects had suspicious malignant lesions and received US-guided biopsy, and 47 malignant lesions, including 35 invasive cancers and 12 carcinoma in situ (CIS) lesions, were diagnosed. More than half (22/35, 63%) of the women with invasive cancer were <50 years of age, and 27 (57.4%) of the 47 cancer cases had early breast cancers. Two invasive cancers (5.7%) and 7 CIS lesions (58.3%) were found at the second-look US. The overall cancer incidence was 1.31% (47/3,586) and increased to 2.2% (78/3,586) if precancerous lesions were included. Subjects aged 41-50 years had the highest incidence of cancer detection (1.97%). Five MRI and US-negative cases had cancers found 1 year after the screening. Conclusions: The results from the one-stop breast screening in this study showed that combining MRI and US is an efficient multimodality tool for screening asymptomatic Asian women in a metropolitan area of Taiwan who had concerns about the diagnosis and radiation of mammography.

Patients and Methods: A multicenter retrospective study of 384 patients from 3 centers specialized in breast cancer surgery was carried out based on an analysis of the various characteristics (clinical, therapeutic, histologic, outcome) of DCIS between two groups of post- and pre-menopausal patients. Results: At the time of diagnosis, 58.6% of the patients were menopausal. Compared to these patients, DCIS in premenopausal women was more frequently associated with initial clinical signs (p=0.006), a larger tumor size (p=0.02), involved margins after initial surgery (p=0.005), and surgical re-excision (p=0.03). The mammograms of the menopausal patients indicated a worse prognosis (using the American College of Radiology Classification) (p=0.025), and according to the histology report findings, more marked comedo necrosis (p=0.01). There was no difference in the other criteria (nuclear grade, multifocality, benign lesions associated with malignancy, relapse and its time of occurrence). The use of hormone replacement therapy had no effect on these data. Conclusion: The characteristics of DCIS are similar, whether occuring before or after the menopause, but the phenotypic expression is different. Menopausal status should not be a criterion for changing patient care.

Cancer Prevention Research		2010	DEC 2010	3	12	1579-1585	1579	1585							Ductal and lobular carcinoma in situ (CIS) accounted for 62,280 (24.5%) of all new breast cancer diagnoses in 2009. BRCA1/2 mutations confer an extremely high risk of breast cancer, and management guidelines for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers advise close follow-up, intensive screening, and consideration of prophylactic surgery to lower this risk. The limited relevant previous data are not definitive in establishing the prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations in breast CIS patients, creating uncertainty as to whether referral for cancer risk assessment and genetic testing is appropriate for this group. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the Myriad Genetics BRCA1/2 database to determine the prevalence of these mutations in breast CIS patients. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and confidence intervals (CI) are reported at the 95% level (alpha = 0.05). The source population was 64,717 consecutive women who were not Ashkenazi Jewish, underwent BRCA1/2 testing, and provided a personal and family history of invasive breast and ovarian cancer; 7,295 (11.3%) reported a diagnosis of CIS (ductal or lobular) and had an overall 5.9% prevalence of mutated BRCA1/2 (mBRCA). Subgrouped by history (personal or family) of invasive breast and/or ovarian cancer, these CIS patients had the following prevalences of mBRCA: (1) no personal or family history, 2.3%; (2) personal history, 5.2%; (3) family history, 5%; and (4) personal and family history, 10.3%. mBRCA risk was significantly higher in women with early-onset (<50 years old) CIS than with late-onset (>= 50 years old) CIS (odds ratio (OR) = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.1). Disease onset at less than 40 years age was associated with an even higher mBRCA risk (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.3-2.3). By far the largest analysis of BRCA1/2 mutation prevalence in non-Ashkenazi Jewish breast CIS patients, this study shows that early-onset CIS is associated with mBRCA1/2 in patients referred for genetic testing. When a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer are also present, testing women with early-onset CIS may increase both the likelihood of detecting BRCA1/2 mutations and opportunities for carriers to consider additional cancer prevention strategies.

Cellular Oncology		2010		32	1-2	87-99	87	99							Background: A major challenge of cancer research is to identify key molecules which are responsible for the development of the malignant metastatic phenotype, the major cause of cancer death.Methods: Four subtracted cDNA libraries were constructed representing mRNAs differentially expressed between benign and malignant human breast tumour cells and between micro-dissected breast carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma. Hundreds of differentially expressed cDNAs from the libraries were micro-arrayed and screened with mRNAs from human breast tumor cell lines and clinical specimens. Gene products were further examined by RT-PCR and correlated with clinical data.Results: The combination of subtractive hybridisation and microarray analysis has identified a panel of 15 cDNAs which shows strong correlations with estrogen receptor status, malignancy or relapse. This panel included S100P, which was associated with aneuploidy in cell lines and relapse/death in patients, and AGR2 which was associated with estrogen receptor and with patient relapse. X-box binding protein-1 is also an estrogen-dependent gene and is associated with better survival for breast cancer patients.Conclusions: The combination of subtracted cDNA libraries and microarray analysis has thus identified potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and targets for cancer therapy, which have not been identified from common prognostic gene signatures.

We utilized gene expression profiling to define molecular signatures associated with transformation and cancer progression in a series of isogenic human breast cancer cell lines including a normal, benign, noninvasive and invasive carcinoma. Clustering analysis revealed four distinct expression patterns based on upregulation or downregulation patterns. These profiles proved quite useful for describing breast cancer tumorigenesis and invasiveness. Downregulation of TNFSF7, S100A4, S100A7, S100A8, and S100A9 (calcium-binding protein family), and upregulation of kallikrein-5 and thrombospondin-1 were associated with transformation and progression of breast cancer cells. Importantly, downregulation of the genes was reversed by treatment with silencing inhibitors, implying the potential roles of epigenetic inactivation in breast carcinogenesis. Exogenous expressions of S100A8 and S100A9 inhibit growth in benign and noninvasive carcinoma cells, suggesting their negative role in cell proliferation. The data presented here may facilitate the identification and functional analyses of prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

British Journal of Cancer		2008	AUG 2008	99	4	611-615	611	615							Approximately 1 in every 600 women attending breast-screening programmes in the United Kingdom is diagnosed with breast carcinoma in situ (BCIS). However, there is little information on the occurrence of subsequent cancers (other than second breast cancers) in these women. We investigated the occurrence of invasive cancers in 12 836 women diagnosed with BCIS in southeast England between 1971 and 2003, using data from the Thames Cancer Registry. A greater than expected number of subsequent cancers was found for two sites: breast ( standardised incidence ratio (SIR) 1.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 - 2.14) and corpus uteri (SIR 1.42; 95% CI 1.11 - 1.78). For subsequent ipsilateral breast cancer in those treated with breast conservation, the excess was independent of the time since diagnosis of BCIS, whereas for subsequent contralateral breast cancer, there was a steady decline in excess over time. For subsequent uterine cancer, the excess became statistically significant only at 45 years after BCIS diagnosis, consistent with a treatment effect. This was further supported by Cox regression anaysis: the risk of subsequent uterine cancer was significantly increased in women receiving hormonal therapy compared with those not receiving it, with a hazard ratio of 2.97 (95% CI 1.84 - 4.80).

(apavbj@humv.es)									APMIS		2008	FEB 2008	116	2	139-146	139	146							Pagetoid dyskeratosis (PD) is considered a selective keratinocytic response in which a small part of the normal population of pale keratinocytes is induced to proliferate. PD has been found incidentally in the squamous epithelium of the skin and mucosas in various locations, but not in the nipple. In cases in which PD cells are conspicuous, there is the danger of overdiagnosis. In a retrospective study, we describe the location and incidence of PD and other pale cells in the nipple epidermis, in 288 mastectomy specimens from women operated on for breast carcinoma, in situ or infiltrating, selected consecutively from our histopathologic files. In addition to the conventional histologic methods an immunohistochemical study was performed in selected cases. PD was found in 184 (63.9%) cases and was a prominent finding in 37 (12.8%) cases. Toker cells (TCs) were identified by standard light microscopy in 24 (8.3%) nipples. Paget carcinoma cells (PCCs) were found in 12 (4.2%) cases, and in 9 (3.1%) they were an incidental finding. The immunohistochemical profile of each type of pale cells was as follows: PD cells, EMA-,LMWCK-,CK7-,HMWCK+, CEA-, HER2/neu protein-, HMB45-, HPV-; TCs, EMA+, LMWCK+, CK7+, HMWCK-, CEA-, HER2/neu protein-, HMB45-, HPV-; PCCs, EMA+, LMWCK+, CK7+, HMWCK-, CEA+, HER2/neu protein+, HMB45-, HPV-. In conclusion, friction may be the stimulus for the appearance of PD cells. PD cells must be distinguished from TCs, PCCs, clear cells of Bowen's disease, pagetoid melanoma cells, cells of clear cell papulosis, koilocytes, artifactual clear cells, and glycogen-rich squamous cells. A combination of immunohistochemical markers is useful for this distinction; however, routine histologic study is usually adequate for recognizing PD. Pathologists should be familiar with the histologic features of PD in the nipple epidermis to avoid misdiagnosis.				Val-Bernal, J.

IL-6, LIF, and gp130 have been associated with cancer progression. Cytokines play an important role in tumoral growth, invasion of the vessels and development of metastases. Immunoexpressions of LIF, OSM, LIFR beta and OSMR beta were studied in benign breast lesion, in situ and infiltrating tumors by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Percentages of positive samples to OSM, LIF and OSMR beta were higher in in situ carcinoma than in benign diseases and even higher in infiltrating tumors. gp130-positive samples was higher in infiltrating tumor than in benign diseases. All samples studied were LIFR beta-positive. Infiltrating tumors showed the most intense immunostaining to LIFR beta, OSM and OSMR beta; comparing present results revealed an association between the expression of these proteins and increasing malignancy. In conclusions, development of breast tumor increases the expression of OSM, LIF, OSMR beta, LIFR beta and gp130, and this expression may be associated with the malignancy. IL-6 family exert their action through transducer receptor gp130, and gp130 expression increase with malignance, it might be a crucial point in the development of infiltrative adenocarcinoma. The secretion of OSM and LIF by both epithelial and stromal (paracrine manner) cells seems to promote tumor growth.

We investigated oral contraceptive use in relation to risk of BCIS in a large population-based case-control study. Female residents of Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire aged 20 to 74 years with a new diagnosis of BCIS (n = 1,878) were identified from state-wide tumor registries in 1997 to 2001. Age-matched female controls (n = 8,041) were randomly selected from population lists. Information on oral contraceptive use and other risk factors was collected during structured telephone interviews. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using logistic regression. In multivariate models, ever use of oral contraceptives was associated with a small and marginally significant increase in BCIS overall (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.99-1.25) and for ductal carcinoma in situ (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.31). No strong associations were detected according to age started, duration, time since first or last use, or oral contraceptive use relative to the first fullterm pregnancy. The slightly increased risk of BCIS seemed limited to former users (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.00-1.27) and women without a family history of breast cancer (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.32 for ever versus never use). Consistent with invasive breast cancer, these results suggest that oral contraceptive use is at most a minor contributor to BCIS risk.														1055-9965		10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-0456																		J	BCI:BCI200800129502				The value of sentinel lymph node biopsy in DCIS(M) of the breast		van la Parra, R.; Ernst, M.

Carcinogenesis (Oxford)		2007	AUG 2007	28	8	1680-1686	1680	1686							Whereas germ line missense mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are associated with a marked predisposition to breast cancer, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may play a more modest role in breast cancer susceptibility. We examined genetic variation in TP53 in relation to breast cancer risk among women aged 20-74 years in a population-based case-control study in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Analyses were conducted separately for in situ (176 cases/581 controls) and invasive (1490 cases/1291 controls) breast cancer. Oral mucosal DNA samples were genotyped for the codon 72 polymorphism in exon 4 (rs1042522), seven intronic SNPs and three SNPs residing in the 3' untranslated region (UTR). Logistic regression was used to obtain age- and state-adjusted odds ratios for individual SNPs. Haplotypes were reconstructed using PHASE software, and the overall association with breast cancer risk was assessed using a global score test. None of the 11 individual SNPs or eight common haplotypes were significantly related to breast carcinoma in situ risk. Among all women, two linked SNPs (D' = 0.99, r(2) = 0.95) on intron 7 (rs12951053, rs12947788) were associated with modest increases in invasive breast cancer risk; however, associations were only significant for heterozygous carriers. The data suggested that additional variants in the 3' UTR (rs9894946), and in two correlated SNPs (D' = 0.94, r(2) = 0.81) in introns 6 (rs1625895) and 4 (rs2909430), were associated with reduced invasive breast cancer risk among women aged 50 and younger only (P-interaction < 0.03). These results indicate that common variation in the TP53 gene could modify the risk of invasive breast cancer.

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2007	JUL 2007	103	3	343-348	343	348							Risk factors for breast carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer were compared using data from 61,844 women (61% post-menopausal) with no prior breast cancer and at least one screening mammogram between April 1, 1996 and June 30, 2001. The women were followed until a subsequent mammogram before July 1, 2001, or a benign biopsy or breast cancer diagnosis before June 30, 2002. A total of 1,191 breast cancers (300 in situ and 891 invasive) were diagnosed during an average follow-up of 3.1 years. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate the relative risks (RR) of in situ and invasive cancer associated with family history of breast cancer, age at first childbirth or nulliparity, post-menopausal hormone use, body mass index (BMI), and mammographic breast density. Separate analyses were done for pre- and post-menopausal women. BMI was unrelated to risk of in situ cancer regardless of menopausal status, but was associated with an increased risk of invasive cancer in post-menopausal women (RR = 1.9 for BMI >= 30 vs. BMI < 22, 95% confidence interval 1.4-2.5). Later childbearing and nulliparity were more strongly associated with in situ than invasive cancer in pre-menopausal women. Post-menopausal hormone use was more strongly associated with invasive disease. RR associated with family history and breast density were similar for in situ cancer and invasive cancer. Results indicating that BMI is related to post-menopausal invasive cancers but unrelated to in situ cancers are consistent with the hypothesis that concomitants of obesity activate proliferation.														0167-6806		10.1007/s10549-006-9375-9																		J	BCI:BCI200700261685	17369670			Breast cancer and the "materiality of risk": The rise of morphological prediction		Lowy, Ilana (lowy@vjf.cnrs.fr)									BULLETIN OF THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE		2007	SPR 2007	81	1	241-266	241	266							This paper follows the history of "morphological risk" of breast cancer. In the early twentieth century, surgeons and pathologists arrived at the conclusion that specific anatomical and cytological changes in the breast are related to a heightened risk of developing a malignancy in the future. This conclusion was directly related to a shift from macroscopic to microscopic diagnosis of malignancics, and to the integration of the frozen section into routine surgery for breast cancer. In the interwar era, conditions such as "chronic mastitis" and "cystic disease of the breast" were defined as precancerous, and women diagnosed with these conditions were advised to undergo mastectomy. In the post-World War II era, these entities were replaced by "carcinoma in situ." The recent development of tests for hereditary predisposition to breast cancer is a continuation of attempts to detect an "embodied risk" of cancer and to eliminate this risk by cutting it out.														0007-5140	1086-3176																			J	BCI:BCI200700233584	17301255			Lifetime recreational and occupational physical activity and risk of in situ and invasive breast cancer		Sprague, Brian L.; Trentham-Dietz, Amy (trentham@wisc.edu) ; Newcomb, Polly A.; Titus-Ernstoff, Linda; Hampton, John M.; Egan, Kathleen M.

We investigated the association between recreational and occupational physical activity and breast cancer risk in a population-based case-control study in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin. During structured telephone interviews, 7,630 controls, 1,689 in situ, and 6,391 invasive breast cancer cases, ages 20 to 69 years, reported lifetime history of recreational physical activity and occupation. Neither lifetime recreational nor strenuous occupational physical activity appeared to be associated with risk of breast carcinoma in situ. In contrast, recreational physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of invasive breast cancer. After adjustment for potentially confounding factors, women averaging > 6 h per week of strenuous recreational activity over their lifetime had a 23% reduction in the odds ratio of invasive breast cancer when compared with women reporting no recreational activity (95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.92; P-trend = 0.05). However, this reduction in risk was limited to women without a first-degree family history of breast cancer (P-interaction = 0.02). Inverse associations were observed for physical activity early in life, in the postmenopausal years, and in the recent past, but these findings were confined to women without a family history of breast cancer. Lifetime strenuous occupational activity was not associated with invasive breast cancer risk. These results provide further evidence that, for most women, physical activity may reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer.

Its in situ counterpart, pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (PLCIS) is a recently described entity. Morphologically it has the typical architectural pattern of LCIS, but the neoplastic cells resemble intermediate grade DCIS. Molecular signatures that distinguish. PLCIS from DCIS and LCIS would provide additional tools to aid in the histopathologic classification of PLCIS as a lesion distinct from LCIS and DCIS. CIS lesions, obtained from a study cohort of 38 breast cancer patients, were divided into 18 DCIS, 14 PLCIS and 6 LCIS. DNA from microdissected archival tissue was interrogated for loss or gain of 112 breast-cancer-specific genes using the Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification Assay (MLPA). Classification Regression Tree (CART) analysis was employed to develop a gene-based molecular classification to distinguish or separate out PLCIS from DCIS and LCIS. Molecular classification via CART, based on gene copy number, agreed with histopathology in 34/38 CIS cases. Loss of CASP1 was predictive of LCIS (n=4) with one misclassified PLCIS. Gain of RELA predicted only the LCIS classification (n=2 cases). STK15 and TNFRSF1B were predictive only for DCIS with no misclassifications. Gain of EHF and TNFRSF1B and loss of NCOA3 were predictive of PLCIS, but not without misclassification. Molecular reclassification by CART was accomplished in 4 CIS cases: I PLCIS was reclassified as LCIS, I LCIS reclassified as PLCIS, and 2 DCIS cases as PLCIS. This study provides additional rationale for molecular modeling strategies in the evaluation of CIS lesions. This diagnostic aid may serve to minimize misclassification between PLCIS and DCIS, and PLCIS and LCIS, aiding to increase accuracy in the differential diagnosis of CIS lesions.														1389-2029		10.2174/138920206779315719																		J	BCI:BCI200600587749	17006721			Oral contraceptive use and risk of breast carcinoma in situ (United States)		Gill, Jasmeet K.; Press, Michael F.; Patel, Alpa V.; Bernstein, Leslie (lbern@usc.edu)									Cancer Causes & Control		2006	NOV 2006	17	9	1155-1162	1155	1162							Objective Our study assesses the impact of oral contraceptive use on breast carcinoma in-situ (BCIS) risk.Methods We conducted a population based case-control study of incident BCIS among black and white women ages 35-64 years residing in Los Angeles County. Case patients (n = 567) were newly diagnosed with BCIS and control participants (n = 614) were identified by random digit dialing between 1 March 1995 and 31 May 1998. All subjects were required to have had a mammogram in the 2 years before case diagnosis or control recruitment. Data were collected during in-person interviews. Multivariable logistic regression analyses provide estimates of odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).Results Oral contraceptive use was not associated with risk of BCIS (OR = 1.04, 95% CI (0.76-1.42)). Risk did not increase with longer periods of use. No associations with BCIS risk were observed for oral contraceptive use before first term pregnancy, age at first oral contraceptive use, or for time since last use. Risk was not modified by estrogen dose, age, race, or parity.Conclusions Our results are consistent with recent results on invasive breast cancer reported for the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences Study and show no association between oral contraceptive use and risk of BCIS.														0957-5243		10.1007/s10552-006-0056-0																		J	BCI:BCI200700086490				hTERT expression in human brest cancer and non-cancerous tissue: the diagnodtic effcacy and correlation with c-Myc expression		Feng, Tang; Chen, Zhong-Qing; Yun, Bao; Zhu, Teng-Fang; Hong, Wang; Zhu, Hong-Guang; Xu, Zu-De; Hu, Xi-Qi (huxiqi@sohu.com)									Fudan Xuebao (Yixueban)		2006	NOV 2006	33	6	727-731	727	731							Purpose To quantitatively measure the expression of hTERT mRNA inhuman brest tissue - explore the diagnostic effcacy and to examine the relationship between c-Myc and hTERT expression. Methods The expression of hTERT mRNA was examined by real-time RT-PCR respectively in normal breast tissue nearby cancer, simple hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma. The expression of c-Myc mRNA in breast cance was also examined by real-time RT-PCR. Results (1) The positive rate of hTERT mRNA expression in carcinoma was 92. 11% (35/38), and the N-hTERT of them was high than the cutoff (N-hTERT = 10). The N-hTERT of all the benign lesions was below the cutoff. (Z The positive correlation between hTERT mRNA and c-Myc mRNA was found in breast carcinoma (gamma = 0.7395 P < 0.01). Conclusions hTERT mRNA expression is significantly higher in human breast carcinoma in situ than in atypical hyperplasia. Quantitative detection of hTERT mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR is helpful in differentiated diagnosis of these two lesions. Activation of c-Myc may play a role in the transcriptive activation of hTERT gene in breast carcinoma.														1672-8467																				J	BCI:BCI200700093546				Role of radiotherapy for the treatment of breast in situ carcinoma	Papel de la radioterapia en el tratamiento del carcinoma in situ de mama	Andreu Martinez, F.

British Journal of Cancer		2006	AUG 7 2006	95	3	347-354	347	354							The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) PRL-1, PRL-2, and PRL-3 in human breast cancer and to evaluate its clinical and prognostic significance. PRL-PTP mRNA expression was examined in malignant (n = 7) and nonmalignant (n = 7) cryoconserved breast tissue samples as well as in eight breast cancer cell lines by RT-PCR. Furthermore, protein expression of PRL-3 was analysed semiquantitatively by immunohistochemistry in ductal breast carcinoma in situ (n = 135) and invasive breast cancer (n = 147) by use of tissue microarray technology (TMA). In 24 lymph node-positive patients we selected the corresponding lymph node metastases for analysis of PRL-3 expression, and a validation set (n = 99) of invasive breast cancer samples was examined. Staining results were correlated with clinicopathological parameters and long-term follow-up. PRL-3 mRNA expression was significantly higher in malignant compared to benign breast tissue. For PRL-1 and PRL-2 expression no significant differences were observed. Staining of TMAs showed PRL-3 expression in 85.9% ductal carcinoma in situ and 75.5% invasive breast carcinomas. Analysis of survival parameters revealed a shorter disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with PRL-3-positive carcinomas, and in particular a significantly shorter DFS in nodal-positive patients with PRL-3 overexpressing tumours as compared to PRL3-negative breast carcinomas (66 +/- 77 months (95% CI, 52-80) vs 97 +/- 79 months (95% CI, 79-115); P = 0.032). Moreover, we found a more frequent expression of PRL-3 in lymph node metastases as compared to the primary tumours (91.7 vs 66.7%; P = 0.033). Our results suggest that PRL-3 might serve as a novel prognostic factor in breast cancer, which may help to predict an adverse disease outcome.

Breast carcinoma in situ patients exhibited a two-fold increased risk of second cancer (standardised incidence ratios (SIR): 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7-2.5). The risk was highest for a second breast cancer (SIR: 3.4, 95% CI: 2.6-4.3; AER: 66 patients per 10 000 per year) followed by skin cancer (SIR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.6; AER: 17 patients per 10 000 per year). The increased risk of second breast cancer was similar for the ipsilateral (SIR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.7) and contralateral (SIR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.4-2.8) breast. Risk of second cancer was independent of age at diagnosis, type of initial therapy, histologic type of BCIS and period of diagnosis. Standardised incidence ratios of second cancer after BCIS (SIR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.8-2.8) resembled that after invasive breast cancer (SIR: 2.2, 95% CI: 2.1-2.4).

The molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypic heterogeneity are very complex with genetic, epigenetic and environmental components. Hypoxia, shortage in oxygen, greatly influences cellular phenotypes by altering the expression of specific genes, and is an important contributor to intra- and inter-tumor cell diversity as revealed by the pronounced but non-uniform expression of hypoxia driven genes in solid tumors (reviewed in [Semenza GL. Targeting HIF-1 for cancer therapy. Nat Rev Cancer 2003;3:721-32; Harris AL. Hypoxia - a key regulatory factor in tumour growth. Nat Rev Cancer 2002;2:38-47.]). The oxygen pressure in solid tumors is generally lower than in the surrounding non-malignant tissues, and tumors exhibiting extensive hypoxia have been shown to be more aggressive than corresponding tumors that are better oxygenized [Vaupel P. Oxygen transport in tumors: characteristics and clinical implications. Adv Exp Med Biol 1996;388:341-51; Vaupel P, Thews 0, Hoeckel M. Treatment resistance of solid tumors: role of hypoxia and anemia. Med Oncol 2001; 18:243-59.]. We recently observed that hypoxic neuroblastoma cells and breast cancer cells loose their differentiated gene expression patterns and develop stem cell-like phenotypes [Jogi A, Ora I, Nilsson H, Lindeheim A, Makino Y, Poellinger L, et a]. Hypoxia alters gene expression in human neuroblastoma cells toward an immature and neural crest-like phenotype. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2002;99:7021-6; Helczynska K, Kronblad A, Jogi A, Nilsson E, Beckman S, Landberg G, et al. Hypoxia promotes a dedifferentiated phenotype in ductal breast carcinoma in situ. Cancer Res 2003;63:1441-4.]. As low stage of differentiation in neuroblastoma and in breast cancer is linked to poor prognosis, hypoxia-induced dedifferentiation will not only contribute to tumor heterogeneity but could also be one mechanism behind increased aggressiveness of hypoxic tumors. The effect(s) of hypoxia on tumor cell differentiation status is the focus of this review. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

British Journal of Cancer		2005	MAY 9 05	92	9	1720-1728	1720	1728							The objective of this study was to investigate expression of various growth factors associated with angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and of their receptors in ductal carcinomas in situ of the breast ( DCIS). We studied protein expression of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A, endothelin ( ET)-1, and VEGF-C, and their receptors bFGF-R1, Flt-1, KDR, ETAR, ETBR, and Flt-4 immunohistochemically in 200 DCIS ( pure DCIS: n = 96; DCIS adjacent to an invasive component: n = 104) using self-constructed tissue microarrays. Basic fibroblast growth factor-R1, VEGF-C, Flt-4, and ETAR were expressed in the tumour cells in the majority of cases, whereas bFGF and Flt-1 expression was rarely observed. VEGF-A, KDR, ET-1, and ETBR were variably expressed. The findings of VEGF-C and its receptor Flt-4 as lymphangiogenic factors being expressed in tumour cells of nearly all DCIS lesions and the observed expression of various angiogenic growth factors in most DCIS suggest that in situ carcinomas are capable of inducing angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Moreover, we found a higher angiogenic activity in pure DCIS as compared to DCIS with concomitant invasive carcinoma. This association of angiogenic factors with pure DCIS was considerably more pronounced in the subgroup of non-high-grade DCIS ( n = 103) as compared with high-grade DCIS ( n = 94). Determination of these angiogenic markers may therefore facilitate discrimination between biologically different subgroups of DCIS and could help to identify a particularly angiogenic subset with a potentially higher probability of recurrence or of progression to invasiveness. For these DCIS, targeting angiogenesis may represent a feasible therapeutic approach for prevention of progression of DCIS to invasion.														0007-0920																				J	BCI:BCI200700269379				Overexpression of CARM1 in human breast carcinoma stimulated breast cancer cell proliferation.

We conducted a case-control study nested within the cohort of the New York University Women's Health Study, a large prospective study documenting a positive association of circulating levels of estrogens and androgens with invasive breast cancer. The study included 69 cases of incident in situ carcinoma and 134 individually matched controls. No statistically significant trend of increasing risk with increasing level of any of the hormones was observed. Odds ratios (95% CIs) for the highest tertile relative to the lowest were 1.10 (0.51-2.39) for estradiol, 0.95 (0.41-2.19) for estrone, 1.63 (0.69-3.88) for testosterone, 0.99 (0.44-2.24) for androstenedione, 0.99 (0.45-2.20) for dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and 0.81 (0.38-1.74) for sex hormone-binding globulin. Adjusting for potential confounders did not materially affect the results, nor did limiting the analysis to the 59 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ, the lesion thought to be the direct precursor of most invasive breast cancers. Our results are at variance with the positive associations observed in this same cohort with risk of invasive breast cancer. Possible explanations for our results include lack of power, an effect of sex hormones limited to the progression from in situ to invasive tumors, over-representation of indolent tumors or an effect of sex hormones on the induction of only a subset of in situ tumors, those that would develop into invasive tumors.

Objective To estimate the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation prevalence in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), unselected for age, family history, or ethnicity. Design, Setting, and Participants The data were 369 DCIS cases diagnosed among female residents aged 20 to 79 years from the state of Connecticut between September 15,1994, and March 14, 1998. These women were participants in a large population-based case-control study of breast carcinoma in situ. Telephone interviews were used to collect risk factor information and blood or buccal specimens were collected for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation testing. Main Outcome Measures Prevalence of disease-associated mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in women diagnosed with DCIS. Results Three (0.8%) and 9 (2.4%) of 369 DCIS cases had disease-associated mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, respectively. One woman had a mutation in both genes (BRCA1 W321X and BRCA2 3398del5). Carriers were significantly more likely than noncarriers to report a first-degree (mother, sister, or daughter) family history of breast cancer (odds ratio (OR), 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1 -12.4), as well as a personal history of ovarian cancer. In addition, carriers were more likely than noncarriers to be diagnosed at an early age (50 years) (OR, 3.4; 95% Cl, 1.0-11.7), as well as to report at least 1 first-degree relative diagnosed with breast cancer before 50 years (OR, 10.6; 95% Cl, 3.0-37.0). Conclusions Ductal carcinoma in situ is a part of the breast/ovarian cancer syndromes defined by BRCA1 and BRCA2, with mutation rates similar to those found for invasive breast cancer. These findings suggest that patients with breast cancer with an appropriate personal or family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer should be screened and followed according to high-risk protocols, regardless of whether they are diagnosed with in situ or invasive breast cancer.														0098-7484		10.1001/jama.293.8.964																		J	BCI:BCI200600219779				Expression of P-cadherin, but not E-cadherin or N-cadherin, relates to pathological and functional differentiation of breast carcinomas		Kovacs, A.; Dhillon, J.; Walker, R.

Incidence patterns are well-established for invasive breast carcinoma (InvBC) overall and for InvBC defined by estrogen receptor (ER) expression, but are not as well-defined for breast carcinoma in situ (CIS). Methods. We, therefore, examined and compared the incidence patterns for CIS and InvBC in the SEER program to define these patterns and to generate etiologic hypotheses. Data were stratified by age 50 and gtoreq50 years to approximate menopause. Results. During the years 1973-2000, annual age-adjusted incidence rates rose 660% for CIS and 36% for InvBC, with the most rapid increases occurring in women age gtoreq50 years. Age-specific incidence rate curves for CIS increased until age 50 years, and then flattened, irrespective of ER expression. On the other hand, rates for InvBC overall and for InvBC defined by ER-positive expression increased continuously with aging, whereas rates for InvBC defined by ER-negative expression flattened after 50 years. Age frequency distribution for CIS and for ER-negative InvBC demonstrated bimodal populations, with a predominant early onset peak incidence at age 50 years. Age frequency distribution for ER-positive InvBC showed bimodal populations with a predominant late-onset mode at age 71 years. Conclusion. Over the last three decades, age-adjusted incidence trends differed for CIS and InvBC in the United States, possibly due to screening mammography and/or etiologic diversity. Indeed, age-specific incidence patterns suggested that carcinogenic events operating early in reproductive life had greater impact upon CIS and InvBC defined by ER-negative expression than upon InvBC overall and InvBC defined by ER-positive expression.														0167-6806		10.1007/s10549-004-1483-9																		J	BCI:BCI200510145555				Anastrozole and low dose tamoxifen in patients with breast carcinoma in situ: a pharmacokinetics and biomarker study.

Immunostaining for estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), p53 and estrogen-responsive RING finger protein (Efp) was also carried out. Immunohistochemically, expression of 14-3-3sigma was seen in 92% UDH lesions and gradually decreased from 65% in DCIS to 23% in IDC. The expression of ERalpha decreased gradually from UDH to DCIS to IDC, while p53 showed an inverse staining pattern to that of ERalpha. The expression of Efp showed no significant difference among the three breast lesions. Hence, the present immunohistochemical study confirmed 14-3-3sigma as a tumor suppressor in breast carcinogenesis. A similar immunohistochemical analysis was then carried out on columnar cell hyperplasia with atypia (CCHA), in which the expression pattern of tumor suppressor 14-3-3sigma, ERalpha and p53 suggested that it might be possible that CCHA is a precancerous lesion.														1320-5463		10.1111/j.1440-1827.2004.01668.x																		J	BCI:BCI200400428018				Risk factors for breast carcinoma in situ vs. invasive breast cancer in a prospective study of pre- and postmenopausal women, 1996-2002		Reinier, K.; Vacek, P.; Geller, B.

Breast CIS, detected primarily on mammography, now represents 30-45% of all screened detected breast cancers. We conducted a large population-based case-control study to evaluate the impact of reproductive factors and lactation on breast CIS risk. Case subjects were newly diagnosed with breast CIS at ages 35-64 years between March 1, 1995 and May 31, 1998 (n = 567), resided in Los Angeles County and were born in the United States. Control subjects (n = 6 14), identified through random digit dialing, fulfilled the same eligibility criteria and were required to have had at least one screening mammogram in the 2-year period before their interview. Women with a positive family history of breast cancer had a 2-fold increase in breast CIS risk. Parous women were at reduced risk relative to nulligravid women (odds ratio (OR) = 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.46-1.00). Among nulliparous women, pregnancy was unrelated to breast CIS risk. Among parous women, risk declined with each additional term pregnancy (p-trend = 0.003). No associations were found with age at first term pregnancy, induced abortion or miscarriage. Long duration of breast-feeding ( gtoreq24 months) was associated with increased risk (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.11-3.60). The observed effects of family history and pregnancy on breast CIS risk are consistent with those observed for invasive breast cancer. The results for breast-feeding are contrary to what has been observed in studies of invasive breast cancer.

Histology and Histopathology		2004	April 2004	19	2	457-463	457	463							This investigation, though initially designed to examine the possible influence of the Bcl-2 protein on the node-metastasizing capacity of breast carcinomas, was amplified to study the expression of this antiapoptotic protein in normal breast lobules and hyperplastic lesions. We examined paraffin sections of 508 breast carcinomas, stained for Bcl-2, estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PgR) and epithelial membrane antigen, and occasionally for other antigens as well. Only a few cells showing a strong Bcl-2 positivity spotted the tubulo-lobular units of normal resting glands, whereas such cells were relatively numerous in atrophic lobules, and very scarce in the terminally differentiated lactating breast. Columnar and usual types of hyperplasia were exclusively, or almost exclusively, composed of Bcl-2(+), ER(+) and PgR(+) cells. The foci of carcinoma in situ and those of invasive carcinomas were respectively 83% and 66% positive for Bcl-2 in at least 25% of their cells. Even among the invasive carcinomas, Bcl-2(+) cases included 83% and 87% of the ER(+) and PgR(+) cases, respectively (p=0.0001). Though there was a statistically significant inverse relation between Bcl-2 and tumor grade (p=0.0001), no significant association was found between Bcl-2 and lymph node stage. In conclusion, we suggest that normal, hyperplastic and neoplastic breast epithelial cells expressing the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 are immature cells that ought to form part of the stem-cell subpopulation, which is committed to the development and to the maintenance of the normal gland and which gives rise to hyperplastic and neoplastic disorders when its proliferation is deregulated. In ductal proliferative changes Bcl-2 assays may be useful for diagnostic but not for prognostic purposes.														0213-3911																				J	BCI:BCI200400420806				Frequency of benign and preinvasive breast diseases		Atlaf, Fadwa J.

The objective of this study is to estimate the magnitude of benign proliferative diseases as well as mammary intra-epithelial neoplasia in the Western region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), in order to encourage nationwide breast cancer screening programs for early detection of the high risk proliferative and pre-invasive breast lesions. Methods: We reviewed histopathology records (reports and slides of selected cases) of 2129 breast cases including mastectomies and breast biopsies from January 1985 to December 2002 in King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital and King Khalid National Guard Hospital, Jeddah. KSA. All he cases and diagnosis are listed and reclassified using systematized nomenclature of medicine (SNOMED) coding system and then regrouped based oil the associated risk factors of developing breast carcinoma. Results: Two thousand one hundred and twenty-nine reports were reviewed and 2343 diagnosis were identified as some cases had more than one diagnosis. The total of benign diagnosis were 1504 after exclusion of malignant diagnosis (558), normal breast tissue, gynecomastia, and non-mammary tissue (281). All diagnosis (1504) were reclassified based on anatomical prognostic indicators into non-proliferative (1283/1504), proliferative (140/1504), atypical hyperplasia (AH) (8/1504), and carcinoma ill Situ (CIS) (73/1504). We compare our findings with the literature and we found that the percentage of benign non-proliferative diagnosis was 85.3% that is higher than the literature 69.7%. Proliferative diseases were 9.3% and atypical hyperplasia was 0.5%, which was lower than the literature 26.2% and 3.6%. Oil the other hand, CIS diagnosis was 4.9%, which is Much higher than the reported literature 1.7%. The Study findings could be explained on the basis of higher prevalence of benign breast lesions in Our population, or it is related to the number of cases studied, or to the diagnostic criteria followed initially. Conclusion: These findings should encourage LIS to refine our diagnostic criteria of proliferative diseases, AH and CIS (mammary intraepithelial neoplasia (MIN)). In addition, we strongly encourage a breast cancer screening program, nationwide.														0379-5284																				J	BCI:BCI200400164300	14700713			Community trends in the early detection of breast cancer in Wisconsin, 1980-1998.

(plreming@wisc.edu) ; Trentham-Dietz, Amy; Robert, Stephanie									American Journal of Preventive Medicine		2004	January 2004	26	1	51-55	51	55							Background: Early detection of breast cancer is an important public health goal. Rates of early detection have increased over the past several decades, contributing to recent declines in mortality. Despite these overall trends, however, some populations have experienced less progress than others. Methods: The rates of early detection, measured as the percentage of breast cancers diagnosed as breast carcinoma in situ, were calculated using data from Wisconsin's population-based tumor registry from 1980 to 1998. Trends in breast cancer (percent diagnosed in situ) were examined over time by socioeconomic characteristics of ZIP code of residence, using census data. Results: The percentage of breast cancer cases that were breast carcinoma in situ was more than five times greater in the later period (1994-1998) (13.9%), compared with the early period (1980-1984) (2.6%). In the middle period (1987-1991), breast cancer was diagnosed as breast carcinoma in situ about one-third less frequently among women in areas with the lowest urbanization, median family income, and percent educated beyond high school, compared with communities with the highest levels of these variables. Recently disparities in early detection rates by community income and education indicators declined slightly, whereas disparities in percent of breast carcinoma in situ by urbanization did not. Conclusions: Communities with lower levels of income, education, and urbanization lagged in the early detection of breast cancer during the 1980s and, despite some progress during the 1990s, continue to be underserved. Women in these communities should be targeted for interventions to improve the early detection of breast cancer.														0749-3797		10.1016/j.amepre.2003.09.006																		J	BCI:BCI200600031469				Surrogate markers of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in ductal breast carcinoma in situ		Wulfing, P.; Kersting, C.; Buerger, H.; Mattsson, B.; Gustmann, C.; Hinrichs, B.; Tio, J.; Boecker, W.; Kiesel, L.

The hospital participation rate was 65% and a sample of 865 patients was collected, distributed by the years 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000. It was observed that, in terms of surgery, there was an increase in conservative surgery, which was over 40% in 2000, as well as an increase in the average of excised axillary lymph nodes. Progress in the surgical approach was similar both in cancer centres and in large and university hospitals, when compared with the other surveyed hospitals. Also, no differences between these two hospital groups in disease-free survival and overall survival were found. Postoperative radiotherapy was employed in more than 90% of the patients submitted to conservative surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy was used in 39% of all the patients, while tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment was used in 58% of the patients.

(elizabeth.claus@yale.edu) ; Stowe, Meredith; Carter, Darryl; Holford, Theodore									Breast		2003	December 2003	12	6	451-456	451	456							Background: Women diagnosed with breast carcinoma in situ are at increased risk for developing a contralateral breast cancer. The magnitude of this risk and the relationship between this risk and age, time since diagnosis, histologic subtype, and treatment for the first breast cancer is continuing to be defined. Methods: The risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer is examined among 4198 women diagnosed with breast carcinoma in situ and reported to the Connecticut Tumor Registry (CTR) between January 1, 1975 and March 14, 1998 using Kaplan-Meier estimation. A Cox proportional hazards model is used to assess the effect of surgical treatment, radiation therapy, age at diagnosis, race, histology, marital status, anatomic location within the breast, and time since diagnosis upon this risk. Results: The cumulative 5- and 10-year probabilities of being diagnosed with a contralateral breast cancer among women initially diagnosed with a ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS) were 4.3% (95% confidence interval, 3.6-5.0%) and 6.8% (95% confidence interval, 5.5-8.2%), respectively. These risks are 3.35 times greater than those for women without a history of breast cancer but are similar to those for women diagnosed with non-metastatic invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast. The cumulative 5- and 10-year probabilities of being diagnosed with a contralateral breast cancer among women initially diagnosed with a lobular breast carcinoma in situ (LCIS) were 11.9% (95% confidence interval, 9.5-14.3%) and 13.9% (95% confidence interval, 11.0-16.8%), respectively. Conclusions: Women diagnosed with LCIS were 2.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.0-3.4%) times more likely than women with DCIS to be diagnosed with a contralateral breast cancer within the first six months of the first breast primary. The risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer more than 6 months after the initial breast cancer was independent of surgical or radiation therapy, time since diagnosis, age at diagnosis, histology, race, marital status, or anatomic location of the cancer within the breast.														0960-9776		10.1016/S0960-9776(03)00152-8																		J	BCI:BCI200400119574	14601085			Lifetime recreational exercise activity and risk of breast carcinoma in situ.

Ductal carcinoma in situ, which accounts for approximately 85% of BCIS and 10-20% of all breast carcinomas, is generally recognized as the final step in the progression to invasive disease. To the authors' knowledge, few studies have been conducted to date to evaluate BCIS risk factors. Because of its potential effects on circulating sex hormones, physical activity has been proposed as a modifiable risk factor for invasive breast carcinoma. However, the relation to BCIS risk is poorly understood. METHODS: The authors analyzed data from a population-based case control study conducted in Los Angeles County. Personal interviews were conducted with 567 white and black women (age range, 35-64 years) who had been newly diagnosed with BCIS between march 1, 1995 and May 31, 1998 and with 1026 control subjects, of whom 616 were screened within 2 years of identification. RESULTS: After excluding unscreened control subjects (n=410) and adjusting for potential confounding factors, the risk of BCIS was approximately 35% lower among women with any exercise activity compared with inactive women, although no significant trend was observed. The association between exercise activity and the risk of BCIS was modified by a family history of breast carcinoma. No reduction in risk was observed among women reporting a first-degree family history of breast carcinoma (homogeneity of trends P value=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study suggest that exercise activity may modify the risk of BCIS, particularly among women without a family history of breast carcinoma.														0008-543X		10.1002/cncr.11768																		J	BCI:BCI200400098818	14652818			Heterogeneous versus homogeneous genetic nature of multiple foci of in situ carcinoma of the breast.		Volante, Marco; Sapino, Anna; Croce, Sabrina; Bussolati, Gianni									Human Pathology		2003	November 2003	34	11	1163-1169	1163	1169							The vast majority of in situ breast cancers represent focal lesions all derived from a single clone and requiring local treatment alone. We focused our attention on rare cases of multicentric in situ carcinomas affecting different quadrants, which required mastectomy. Defining the origin from single- or multiple-cell clones of separate independent neoplastic foci in the breast may be of pathogenetic interest and of importance in deciding the type of therapy to be administered. We employed a molecular assay based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and human androgen receptor assay (HUMARA) analysis of microdissected samples from 19 mastectomies. Two or more tissue samples were obtained from 7 patients with multicentric lobular in situ carcinoma (LCIS), either classical or large-cell variety; and 12 patients with multicentric ductal in situ carcinomas (DCIS), either low-grade (7 cases) or high-grade (5 cases) variety. Separate foci of high-grade (comedonic) DCIS were found to be monoclonal in nature. On the contrary, definite evidence favoring the origin from different cell clones of separate carcinomatous foci within the same breast was obtained in 2 cases of low-grade DCIS and in 6 cases of LCIS. A genetic imbalance might be the factor favoring the development of multifocal heterogeneous foci of in situ breast cancer. Such a small subgroup of in situ cancers affecting diffusely the entire breast and originating from independent foci presents both clinical and pathogenetic interest.

No study has examined the relationship between oral contraceptive use and the risk of non-invasive breast carcinoma, that is, breast carcinoma in situ. Objective. To define the role of oral contraceptive use in the development of breast carcinoma in situ. Methods. The data are 875 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cases diagnosed among residents of the state of Connecticut from September 15, 1994 to March 14, 1998 and between the age of 20 and 79 years as well as 999 control subjects. Controls are female Connecticut residents collected via random-digit-dial and frequency matched to the cases by 5-year age intervals. Telephone interviews were used to collect information on risk factors and cancer screening history. Logistic regression was used to provide maximum likelihood estimates of the odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results. The risk of being diagnosed with DCIS for women who had ever used oral contraceptives was not increased relative to women who had never used them (OR: 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.2). The risk did not significantly increase with duration of oral contraceptive use, nor with duration of high estrogen use, time since last use, progestin or estrogen type, or age at first use. Furthermore, the association between oral contraceptive use and DCIS risk did not vary by the presence of a family history of breast cancer or by menopausal status. Conclusions. In these data, no evidence was found for an increased risk of ductal carcinoma in situ associated with the use of oral contraceptives.														0167-6806		10.1023/A:1025728524310																		J	BCI:BCI200300533180				p63 expression in benign and malignant breast lesions.

We tested whether hypoxia-induced dedifferentiation also occurs in vivo in mammary ductal carcinoma in situ with its well-defined lesions and distinct areas of necrosis. Ductal carcinoma in situ cells surrounding the central necrosis have high hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha protein levels, down-regulated estrogen receptor-alpha, and increased expression of the epithelial breast stem cell marker cytokeratin 19; lose their polarization; and acquire an increased nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, hallmarks of poor architectural and cellular differentiation. The hypoxia-induced changes were confirmed in cultured breast cancer cells. We propose that hypoxia-induced dedifferentiation is a mechanism that promotes tumor progression in breast cancer.														0008-5472																				J	BCI:BCI200300163668	12611452			Family history of breast and ovarian cancer and the risk of breast carcinoma in situ.

(claus@biomed.med.yale.edu) ; Stowe, Meredith; Carter, Darryl									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2003	March 2003	78	1	7-15	7	15							A family history of breast cancer is an important risk factor for breast carcinoma in situ (BCIS), however, there are no detailed analyses of its variation in effect by number, type, laterality or age at onset of affected relatives nor by association with ovarian cancer. In addition, the role of the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, in the development of BCIS is unclear. Objective: To better define the role of: (1) a family history of breast and ovarian cancer and (2) the cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, in the development of BCIS. Methods: The data are 875 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 123 lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) cases diagnosed among residents of the state of Connecticut from September 15, 1994 to March 14, 1998 and between the age of 20 and 79 years. Controls (n=999) are female Connecticut residents collected via random-digit-dial and frequency matched to the cases by 5-year age intervals. Telephone interviews were used to collect information on risk factors and cancer screening history. Logistic regression was used to provide maximum likelihood estimates of the odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The probability of being a BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene carrier was calculated for each case and control, using family history of breast and ovarian cancer, age/age at diagnosis for relatives, prevalence and penetrance data for BRCA1/BRCA2, and self-report of Jewish heritage. Results: Cases with DCIS or LCIS were significantly more likely to report a first degree family history of breast cancer (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.3, 2.1 and 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.9, respectively) than were controls. In addition, DCIS cases were 2.4 (95% CI: 0.8, 7.2) times more likely than controls to report both an affected mother and sister. An inverse association was suggested between age at onset and DCIS risk with cases aged 49 years or younger at 2.1 (95% CI: 1.3, 3.4) times the risk of controls (95% CI) versus 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1, 2.0) for cases older than 49 years. An elevated risk of DCIS was associated with a family history of ovarian cancer but did not reach statistical significance (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 0.7, 2.5). Approximately 3.7% and 1.9% of DCIS cases were predicted to carry a mutation in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively. Conclusions: A family history of breast cancer is associated with an increased risk of DCIS and LCIS, particularly among women with multiple relatives affected at early ages. Statistical risk models predict a low prevalence rate of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in DCIS; these estimates await confirmation through laboratory testing.														0167-6806		10.1023/A:1022147920262																		J	BCI:BCI200300258763				Regulation of angiogenic factors in DMBA-induced rat mammary pathologies.

From whole tissue sections we analyzed RNA for VEGF, BFGF, TNF-alpha, MMP9, MMP2, MASPIN, IGF-1, IGF-2, TSP-1 and TIMP-1 by RT-PCR. VEGF expression was further analyzed in the stroma vs. the epithelium using laser capture microdissection and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Results: The number of positive cases was increased for MMP9, MMP2, and BFGF in CIS and INV, relative to earlier stages of progression. TNF-alpha was decreased at this stage and the other factors were unchanged. VEGF was ubiquitously expressed throughout progression, with a significant (three-fold) increase in mean level of expression in INV in both the epithelium and the stroma.Conclusions: The expression of angiogenic regulators varies, dependent upon stage of progression. Agents to block angiogenesis may function in a stage-specific fashion.These studies were funded by the NCI (R01-CA82996).														0892-6638																				J	BCI:BCI200300251809				Mammographic density and obesity as risk factors for invasive breast cancer following ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

Rodrigues, Neesha; Carter, Darryl; Dillon, Deborah; Parisot, Nicole; Choi, Doo Ho; Haffty, Bruce G. (bruce.haffty@yale.edu)									International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics		2002	December 1, 2002	54	5	1331-1335	1331	1335							Purpose: Although breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy (RT) has become a standard treatment option for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, risk factors for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) in these patients remain an active area of investigation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of clinical and pathologic features on long-term outcome in a cohort of DCIS patients treated with breast-conserving surgery plus RT. Methods and Materials: Between 1973 and 1998, 230 patients with DCIS were treated with breast-conserving surgery plus RT at our institution. All patients were treated by local excision followed by RT to the breast to a total median tumor bed dose of 64 Gy. Adjuvant hormonal therapy was used in only 20 patients (9%). All available clinical, pathologic, and outcome data, including ipsilateral and contralateral events, were entered into a computerized database. The clinical and pathologic variables evaluated included detection method, mammo- graphic appearance, age, family history, histologic subtype, presence of necrosis, nuclear grade, final margin status, and use of adjuvant hormonal therapy. Results: As of December 15, 2000, with a median follow-up of 8.2 years, 17 patients had developed a recurrence in the ipsilateral breast, resulting in a 5- and 10-year IBTR rate of 5% and 13%, respectively. Contralateral breast cancer developed in 8 patients, resulting in a 10-year contralateral recurrence rate of 5%. Patient age, family history, histologic subtype, margin status, and tumor grade were not significantly associated with recurrence on univariate analysis. A significantly higher rate of local relapse was observed in patients with the presence of necrosis. The 10-year relapse rate was 22% in 88 patients with necrosis compared with 7% in 142 patients without necrosis (p <0.01). In multivariate analysis, the presence of necrosis remained a significant predictor of local relapse. No breast relapses occurred among the 8 patients with positive margins, and three relapses developed among 21 patients with close margins. The rate of IBTR in those with close/positive margins did not differ from the rate in those with negative or unknown margins. It is also notable that none of the 20 patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen had developed IBTR or a contralateral event to date, although the follow-up on this group was still too short to reach significance. Conclusion: In this cohort of uniformly treated patients with a relatively long follow-up, the presence of necrosis was a significant predictor of local relapse. However, positive or close margin status was not a significant predictor of local relapse. Although none of the patients receiving tamoxifen had a recurrence in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast, longer follow-up is required to assess the effect of tamoxifen on these end points.														0360-3016		10.1016/S0360-3016(02)03747-1																		J	BCI:BCI200200576202	12354814			Multiple fibroadenomas harbouring carcinoma in situ in a woman with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer		Kuijper, A.; Preisler-Adams, S. S.; Rahusen, F. D.; Gille, J. J. P.; van der Wall, E.; van Diest, P. J.									Journal of Clinical Pathology (London)		2002	October, 2002	55	10	795-797	795	797							A 46 year old woman with a family history of breast and ovarian cancer presented with multiple fibroadenomas in both breasts. From three fibroadenomas removed from the left breast carcinoma in situ (CIS) had developed. One fibroadenoma gave rise to ductal CIS, whereas the other two harboured lobular CIS. This is the first report of three fibroadenomas simultaneously giving rise to CIS. In addition, synchronous fibroadenomas harbouring different types of CIS from one fibroadenoma to the other have never been described. Direct sequencing revealed a mutation (5075GfwdarwA) in the BRCA1 gene, but retention of BRCA1 immunohistochemical staining and no loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1 locus by polymerase chain reaction made a pathogenic mutation in BRCA1 unlikely. Furthermore, in this family no cosegregation of breast cancer with this BRCA1 mutation was seen. Indeed, this mutation is now regarded as a polymorphism. This case stresses the need for histological evaluation of all breast masses in women with a strong positive family history for breast and/or ovarian cancer.														0021-9746		10.1136/jcp.55.10.795																		J	BCI:BCI200200450391	12118344			DNA content and cell number determination in microdissected samples of breast carcinoma in situ		Blumenstein, Robert; Dias, Margarida; Russo, Irma H.; Tahin, Quivo; Russo, Jose									International Journal of Oncology		2002	August, 2002	21	2	447-450	447	450							Paraffin-embedded tissue (PET) is the specimen of choice for the histopathological diagnosis of cancer. PET has become a valuable resource for correlating cellular phenotype and genotype in microdissected lesions. A definitive improvement in this field has been the development of infrared laser capture microdissection (LCM), which yields homogeneous populations of cells for DNA extraction and in vitro amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We report here a photographic and fluorescent technique for determining the number of nuclei and concentration of DNA obtained respectively by laser capture microdissection from paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue. Breast biopsies containing carcinoma in situ were serially sectioned, mounted on plain glass slides and tumor cells were microdissected using a laser capture microscope. The DNA was extracted in digestion buffer and used directly as a template for PCR. In our protocols, each capture contained 21+-5.4 nuclei with a DNA concentration of 115+-5.3 pg. Also, a linear relationship was found between number of captures and DNA content (R2=0.9995). These results represent a novel contribution for a more precise correlation between phenotypic and genotypic diversity in cancer cells studied from microdissected paraffin-embedded tissue.														1019-6439																				J	BCI:BCI200200428850	12160327			Ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: A new phenotype classification system and its relation to prognosis		Warnberg, F.; Casalini, P.; Nordgren, H.; Bergkvist, L.; Holmberg, L.; Menard, S.									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2002	June, 2002	73	3	215-221	215	221							In a study of invasive breast cancer, multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) revealed clustering of eight pathobiological variables. Two different phenotypes were distinguished by an index calculated on the basis of the variables (histologic grade, necrosis, lymphoid infiltration, number of mitosis and expression of c-erbB-2, p53, progesterone receptor and Bcl-2). Phenotype A lesions share most of the features of normal breast tissue. Phenotype B looks more malignant, has a higher early recurrence rate and is more frequently seen in younger patients. Our aim was to see if ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS) could be divided into the same phenotypes. One hundred and eighty DCIS were investigated. Association between the eight variables was studied in 2X2 models. The phenotype index was calculated by summing weights for the variables in the MCA. All variables were associated, except Bcl-2. DCIS was divided in two phenotypes. Thirty-three tumours were Phenotype A and 147 Phenotype B. The mean age at diagnosis was 65.5 and 58.4 years for Phenotypes A and B, respectively (p=0.0012). No difference regarding local relapse free survival was seen. Two phenotypes were distinguished in DCIS, similar to invasive breast cancer. In an earlier study, 45% of the invasive cancers were classified as Phenotype B. In this study, 82% of DCIS were Phenotype B. This may indicate that invasive breast cancer of Phenotype B is derived from DCIS of Phenotype B. The distribution of DCIS phenotypes with a small proportion of Phenotype A DCIS may be due to that Phenotype A DCIS is less likely to be detected by mammography, or that some invasive breast cancers of Phenotype A progress to invasiveness without passing the in situ phase.														0167-6806		10.1023/A:1015816406078																		J	BCI:BCI200200334052	12173319			Proceedings of the consensus conference on the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in carcinoma of the breast, April 19-22, 2001, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania		Schwartz, Gordon F.; Giuliano, Armando E.; Veronesi, Umberto; Consensus Conference Committee									Cancer		2002	May 15, 2002	94	10	2542-2551	2542	2551											Doherty, Gerard/0000-0002-1685-9552										0008-543X		10.1002/cncr.10539																		J	BCI:BCI200200479011	12168931			The role of lymphocytes and macrophages in human breast tumorigenesis: An immunohistochemical and morphometric study		ben-Hur, Herzl; Cohen, Ophir; Schneider, David; Gurevich, Pavel; Halperin, Reuvit; Bala, Uri; Mozes, Marta; Zusman, Itshak									Anticancer Research		2002	March-April, 2002	22	2B	1231-1238	1231	1238							The objective of the present study was to analyze the function of lymphoid elements in the tumorigenesis of human breast cancer, similar to their elucidation in human ovarian cancer in our previous work. The lymphocytic and macrophageal content of lymphocytes and macrophages was analyzed immunohistochemically and morphometrically in 49 human breast tumors of different types. The following types of tumors were studied: 1) fibrocystic disease, 2) fibroadenoma, 3) carcinoma in situ, 4) infiltrating ductal and lobular carcinoma with high lymphoid infiltration, and 5) infiltrating ductal and lobular carcinoma with lymphoid depletion. The first two had little lymphoid infiltration and few lymphocytes (mainly T cells), while carcinoma in situ had extensive lymphoid infiltration and increased lymphocytic density, the consequence of a sharp rise in total lymphocytes reflecting the intensified immune response. In ductal and lobular infiltrating carcinoma with high infiltration, T cells were in large excess of B cells (81% and 87% vs. 11%) and CD8+ lymphocytes were the predominant type of T cells (up to 90%), in both tumoral parenchyma and stroma. In infiltrating carcinoma with lymphoid depletion, the total lymphocyte and macrophage count and areas of lymphoid infiltrates decreased, relative to highly infiltrated carcinomas, as signs of deep subcompensation of the lymphoid system. The host's reaction to disease was reflected in high correlations between the densities of the lymphoid cellular elements as tumorigenesis evolved. We suggest that the stromal immunocompetent cells are a reservoir of T killers that eventually cross into the parenchyma and join T helpers and B lymphocytes in the immune antitumor response. In later stages of cancer the response is exhausted, as manifested in lymphoid subcompensation.														0250-7005																				J	BCI:BCI200200308990	12038707			Loss of co-ordinate expression of progesterone receptors A and B is an early event in breast carcinogenesis		Mote, P. A.; Bartow, S.; Tran, N.; Clarke, C. L.									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2002	March, 2002	72	2	163-172	163	172							Progesterone receptor (PR) mediates the effects of progesterone in mammary tissues and plays a crucial role in normal breast development and in breast cancer. PR proteins are expressed as two isoforms, PRA and PRB, that have different capacities to activate target genes, yet it is unknown whether progesterone action in normal and malignant breast is mediated by PRA and/or PRB. This study determines the relative expression of PRA and PRB in normal breast and in benign, premalignant and malignant archival breast lesions by dual immunofluorescent histochemistry. In normal breast and in proliferative disease without atypia (PDWA) PRA and PRB were co-expressed within the same cells in comparable amounts, implicating both isoforms in progesterone action. In atypical lesions, however, there was a significant increase in predominant expression of PRA or PRB, with lesion progression from the normal state to malignancy. PR isoform predominance, especially PRA predominance, was evident in a high proportion of ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast lesions. In the normal breast and in PDWA, the relative expression of PRA and PRB in adjacent cells was homogenous. There was a significant increase in cell-to-cell heterogeneity of PR isoform expression in ADH and DCIS lesions and in the majority of breast cancers. Heterogeneous cell-to-cell expression of PR isoforms occurred prior to overall predominant expression of one isoform in premalignant breast lesions, demonstrating that loss of control of relative PRA:PRB expression is an early event in the development of breast cancer. PRA:PRB ratios within a breast lesion are likely to be important as both markers and effectors of tumor growth and development, and progressively aberrant PR isoform expression may play a role in the etiology of breast cancer.

Recent studies have demonstrated that alterations in the expression of adhesion molecules in cancer cells are related to aggressiveness and poor prognosis. The aim of our study was to investigate the expression of P-cadherin in breast carcinomas and correlate it with estrogen receptor (ER) status. We selected 73 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) and 149 invasive carcinomas of the breast, and assessed the expression of P-cadherin as well as other biologic markers. P-cadherin expression showed a strong inverse correlation with ER expression in both types of breast carcinoma (in situ and invasive). P-cadherin-positive and ER-negative tumors were related to a higher histologic grade, a high proliferation rate, and expression of c-erbB-2. We demonstrated that P-cadherin identifies a subgroup of breast carcinomas that lacks ER expression, and correlates with higher proliferation rates and other predictors of aggressive behavior. We believe that these tumors represent an advanced step in cancer progression, and our data support the hypothesis that an estrogen-independent pathway regulates P-cadherin expression.

Methods: We conducted a population-based, case-control study among female residents of Connecticut to identify risk factors for breast carcinoma in situ. Case patients, diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (n = 875) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (n = 123), were matched by 5-year age groups with control subjects (n = 999). Case patients were diagnosed between September 15, 1994, through March 14, 1998, and all subjects were between the ages of 20 and 79 years. Information on risk factors and cancer-screening history was collected by telephone interviews. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine odds ratios (ORs) for the association of these factors with the risk of DCIS and LCIS. Results: Case patients with DCIS were more likely than control subjects to report a family history of breast cancer (OR = 1.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19 to 1.85) or previous breast biopsy (OR = 3.56; 95% CI = 2.86 to 4.43). They also had fewer full-term pregnancies (OR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.80 to 0.93) and were older at first full-term pregnancy (OR for being 20-29 years old relative to being <20 years old = 1.68; 95% CI = 1.17 to 2.43) and at menopause (OR for being gtoreq55 years old relative to being <45 years old = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.05 to 2.77). DCIS case patients were more likely than control subjects to have had a mammographic examination (OR = 2.46; 95% CI = 1.78 to 3.40) or an annual clinical breast examination (OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.48 to 2.26). DCIS patients and control subjects did not differ with respect to oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy, alcohol consumption or smoking history, or breast self-examination. Associations for LCIS were similar. Conclusions: The risk factors associated with DCIS and LCIS are similar to those associated with invasive breast cancer. Diagnosis of DCIS is associated with increased mammography screening.														0027-8874		10.1093/jnci/93.23.1811																		J	BCI:BCI200100545275	14965621			Incidence of second cancers among women with in situ carcinoma of the breast		Crocetti, E.; Miccinesi, G.; Paci, E.; Zappa, M.

All cases, diagnosed between 1985 and 1997, have been followed up to the end of 1997. During 1707 person-years of follow-up, 27 further invasive cancers were diagnosed while 13.7 were expected (Observed/Expected=2.0, P<0.05). The relative risk for invasive breast cancers was 3.7 (P<0.05). According to the surgical treatment for CIS and the site of further invasive breast cancer, no side specific difference was evident. No significant increase was evident for other cancer sites; only non-melanomatous skin cancers occurred more frequently than expected (O/E=4.2). The cumulative risk of developing an invasive cancer after CIS was 13.2% at 10 years. There were also two deaths due to breast cancer (O/E=8.3; P<0.05) corresponding to a cumulative mortality risk of 2% at 10 years. We have quantified the risk of developing an invasive breast cancer among women with CIS of the breast as four times that of the general population.														0960-9776		10.1054/brst.2001.0290																		J	BCI:BCI200200071935				Surgical treatment and prognosis of breast carcinoma in situ		Gu Yuanting; E'erdun; Wang Zhongfu; et al									Zhongguo Zhongliu Linchuang		2001	Sep. 20, 2001	28	9	677-678	677	678							Objective: To study the curative effect of operation and the prognosis of breast carcinoma in situ. Methods: In the period of 20 years follow up, 97 cases of breast cancer in situ were studied retrospectively.

The modality of operation showed no difference in the prognosis of these patients (P>0.05).

British Journal of Cancer		2001	14 September, 2001	85	6	869-874	869	874							Ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is regarded as a precursor to invasive breast cancer. The progression from in situ to invasive cancer is however little understood. We compared some tumour markers in invasive and in situ breast carcinomas trying to find steps in this progression. We designed a semi-experimental setting and compared histopathological grading and tumour marker expression in pure DCIS (n = 194), small invasive lesions (n = 127) and lesions with both an invasive and in situ component (n = 305). Grading was done according to the Elston-Ellis and EORTC classification systems, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted for p53, c-erbB-2, Ki-67, ER, PR, bcl-2 and angiogenesis. All markers correlated with grade rather than with invasiveness. No marker was clearly associated with the progression from in situ to invasiveness. The expression of tumour markers was almost identical in the 2 components of mixed lesions. DCIS as a group showed a more 'malignant picture' than invasive cancer according to the markers, probably, due to a higher proportion of poorly differentiated lesions. The step between in situ and invasive cancer seems to occur independently of tumour grade. The results suggest that well-differentiated DCIS progress to well-differentiated invasive cancer and poorly differentiated DCIS progress to poorly differentiated invasive cancer.														0007-0920		10.1054/bjoc.2001.1995																		J	BCI:BCI200100320719	11369138			Contribution of germline MLH1 and MSH2 mutations to lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast		Stone, J.

Cancer Letters		2001	June 26, 2001	167	2	171-174	171	174							Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is an unusual histological pattern of non-invasive neoplastic disease of the breast occurring predominantly in women aged between 40 and 50 years. LCIS is frequently multicentric and bilateral suggesting a genetic basis to the disease. The high frequency of microsatellite instability in lobular breast cancers, coupled with increased risk of breast cancer associated with germline mismatch repair gene mutations raises the possibility that mutations MSH2 or MLH1 might confer susceptibility to LCIS. To explore this possibility we have examined a series of 71 LCIS patients for germline MSH2 and MLH1 mutations. No mutations were detected in MSH2. Two sequence variants were identified in MLH1. The first was a CTT fwdarw CAT substitution, codon 607 (exon 16) changing leucine to histidine. The other mutation detected in MLH1 was a TAC fwdarw TAA substitution codon 750 (exon 19) creating a stop codon, predicted to generate a truncated protein. These findings suggest that mutations in MLH1 may underlie a subset of LCIS cases.			gusterson, barry/D-3752-2009	Houlston, Richard/0000-0002-5268-0242; Lakhani, Sunil/0000-0003-4067-2760										0304-3835		10.1016/S0304-3835(01)00448-7																		J	BCI:BCI200100361944	11444192			Computerized image analysis of Ki-67 in ductal breast carcinoma in situ		Menter, David G.; Hoque, Ashraful; Motiwala, Nisrin; Sahin, Aysegul A.; Sneige, Nour; Lieberman, Ronald; Lippman, Scott M.

STUDY DESIGN: We compared conventional brightfield light microscopy and refractive optical enhancement methods in combination with various immunodetection and filter enhancement methods, including immunogold in combination with epipolarization refractive optics and enzymatic conversion of chromogenic substrates in combination with optical filter enhancement. Initial Ki-67 tests were performed on lymph node tissues and cultured human breast cells and then applied to 200 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) samples. DCIS acini were digitally acquired, and a region of interest was manually outlined in each one with a digital stylus to include only the cellular component; then the Ki-67 staining index was quantified by segmentation analysis. RESULTS: Although combining epipolarization analysis with immunohistogold staining was the most sensitive detection method, nonspecific binding was too high. The streptavidin-horseradish-peroxidase enzymatic conversion of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) in combination with optical enhancement filters was the most effective method tested. Ki-67 stain was associated with dense fibrillar structures of the nucleoli in the less intensely staining nuclei and was most intense in paired nuclei. CONCLUSION: The method of measuring Ki-67 expression by DAB staining combined with optical enhancement filters and quantification via computer-assisted image analysis techniques produced objective and reproducible results. As such, this method can offer (1) less intraobserver and interobserver variability, (2) a digital archival record, and (3) a baseline for digital exchange of information between studies.														0884-6812																				J	BCI:BCI200100213049	11322170			Disparate E-cadherin mutations in LCIS and associated invasive breast carcinomas		Rieger-Christ, K.

Molecular Pathology		2001	April, 2001	54	2	91-97	91	97							Aims: The relation between lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and invasive breast cancer is unresolved. In an attempt to establish whether LCIS is a precursor of invasive cancer the mutational status and the expression of E-cadherin was analysed in LCIS and associated invasive breast carcinoma in 23 patients. Methods: Foci of LCIS and associated invasive carcinoma were individually microdissected from tissue from 23 patients. Exons 4-16 of the E-cadherin gene were analysed using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP); protein expression and the localisation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin were assessed with the use of immunohistochemistry. Results: Immunohistochemistry revealed a lack of expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in most LCIS samples and invasive foci. In all but four cases, the staining pattern was identical in the LCIS and associated invasive areas. When E-cadherin was absent, beta-catenin was also undetected, suggesting a lack of expression of alternative classic cadherin members in these lesions. Coincident E-cadherin mutations in LCIS and associated invasive carcinoma were not identified in this series of patients. However, mutational analysis of E-cadherin in multiple foci of carcinoma in situ surrounding an invasive lesion provided evidence to support ductal carcinoma in situ as a precursor of invasive ductal carcinoma. Conclusion: These data support the hypothesis that LCIS is not a precursor of invasive breast carcinoma but a marker of increased risk of developing invasive disease.

American Journal of Surgical Pathology		2001	February, 2001	25	2	229-236	229	236							Most breast carcinomas in situ (CIS) are easily categorized as ductal (DCIS) or lobular (LCIS). However, some CIS have indeterminate histologic features (CIS-IF). Prior studies have shown that E-cadherin protein expression is lost in lobular but not ductal carcinomas. Therefore, evaluation of examples of CIS-IF for E-cadherin expression by immunohistochemistry might be useful in helping to define their nature. To address this, we studied histologic features and E-cadherin expression by immunohistochemistry in 89 cases of breast CIS (28 LCIS, 33 DCIS, 28 CIS-IF). CIS-IF cases were divided into three groups based on histology: Group 1 cases had all the cytologic and architectural features typical of LCIS but showed areas of comedo-type necrosis (n = 6). Group 2 cases were CIS lesions characterized by small, uniform neoplastic cells either growing in a solid pattern with focal microacinar-like structures but with cellular dyshesion, or growing in a cohesive mosaic pattern but with occasional intracytoplasmic vacuoles (n = 17). Group 3 cases showed marked cellular pleomorphism and nuclear atypia but had the dyshesive growth pattern characteristic of LCIS (n = 5). E-cadherin staining was scored as negative, positive, or mixed (mixture of negative and positive tumor cells). All 28 cases of LCIS were E-cadherin negative, and all 33 DCIS cases were E-cadherin positive by immunohistochemistry. All cases from CIS-IF group 1 and group 3 were negative for E-cadherin, suggesting a closer kinship to LCIS than to DCIS. In contrast, CIS-IF group 2 cases were heterogeneous with respect to E-cadherin staining. Six (35.3%) cases were E-cadherin negative (more akin to LCIS), 5 (29.4%) cases were E-cadherin positive (akin to DCIS), and 6 (35.3%) cases had both E-cadherin-positive and E-cadherin-negative tumor cells, suggesting a mixed DCIS/LCIS phenotype. Our findings suggest that E-cadherin immunostaining is of value in helping to characterize breast carcinomas in situ with indeterminate features. However, validation of these observations will require clinical outcome studies.														0147-5185		10.1097/00000478-200102000-00011																		S	BCI:BCI200200146190				The Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH): Trial key points and remaining questions		Powles, Trevor J.

Our studies in a series of pure ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) were conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the international Consensus Conference (Hum. Pathol., 28, 122-125, 1997) relative to processing, determination of lesion extent, and histological stratification primarily on nuclear grade (NG). A multifactorial study performed in 15 low- and 16 high-NG DCIS (68% detected by mammography) included the following: (1) morphological analysis of NG, necrosis, and architectural pattern; (2) detection of numerical genomic abnormalities at ERBB2, MYC, CCND1, Xq1.2 and 20q13 loci by fluorescence in situ hybridization on interphase nuclei; and (3) immunohistochemical determination of cell proliferation, p53 accumulation, hormonal receptors and bcl-2 expression on serial sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. High NG, comedo/solid pattern and necrosis were significantly associated with amplification at one or more loci, the number of amplified loci, amplification at the ERBB2 locus, absence of bcl-2 and hormonal receptor expression and high cell proliferation (p < 0.05). High NG and comedo/solid pattern were significantly associated with MYC amplification and p53 accumulation, and necrosis with CCND1 amplification (the only gene amplification detected in low NG DCIS). These data provide additional information on the early steps of breast carcinogenesis, in accordance with currently recognized criteria of histological classification.														0020-7136		10.1002/1097-0215(20000920)89:5<403::AID-IJC2>3.0.CO;2-3																		J	BCI:BCI200000458472				UKCCCR DCIS Trial: The histopathology review		Pinder, S.

Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention		2000	July, 2000	9	7	697-703	697	703							As more women obtain screening mammograms regularly and at younger ages, the diagnosis of breast carcinoma in situ becomes more frequent. To examine whether risk factors for carcinoma in situ correspond with risk factors for invasive breast cancer, we analyzed data from a population-based case-control study conducted in 1988-1990. We identified newly diagnosed cases of carcinoma in situ (n = 301) and invasive breast cancer (n = 3789) in women 18-74 years of age from Wisconsin's statewide tumor registry. Cases and population controls (n = 3999) completed structured telephone interviews. Overall, associations with risk of carcinoma in situ in relation to many reproductive life-style risk factors were similar to those associated with risk of invasive disease. Women who reported a family history of breast cancer had a 2-fold elevated risk of carcinoma in situ (odds ratio, 2.67; 95% confidence interval, 2.00-3.57). Personal history of benign biopsied breast disease also increased risk of carcinoma in situ (odds ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.62-2.95). Subgroup analysis suggested that high vitamin A intake and high alcohol intake may be associated with risk of ductal but not lobular carcinoma in situ. These data support the presence of common risk factors between in situ and invasive breast cancer.														1055-9965																				J	BCI:BCI200000385470	10923925			Stromelysin-3 expression in noninvasive and invasive neoplasms of the urinary bladder		Mueller, James; Steiner, Christine; Hoefler, Heinz									Human Pathology		2000	July, 2000	31	7	860-865	860	865							Stromelysin-3 (ST-3) is a protease frequently expressed by fibroblasts surrounding invasive carcinomas. Based on its expression in some cases of breast carcinoma-in-situ, it has been thought to indicate a higher likelihood for subsequent invasion in preinvasive lesions. Carcinoma-in-situ (pTis) and noninvasive papillary tumor (pTa) of the urinary bladder are preinvasive lesions with an uncertain potential to become invasive. We studied the expression of ST-3 in pTis, pTa, and invasive bladder tumors to see whether it had an association with any established histopathologic variables and whether its expression might be an indicator of incipient invasion in the preinvasive lesions. Twenty-seven pTis, 27 pTa tumors, and 56 invasive bladder carcinomas were studied for ST-3 expression with immunohistochemistry and, in selected cases, with in situ hybridization. Staining for ST-3 was evaluated semiquantitatively. None of 27 pTis lesions, 4 of 27 pTa tumors, and 41 of 56 (73.2%) invasive carcinomas were positive for ST-3. Statistically significant associations were found in the invasive carcinomas between ST-3 expression and lymphatic vessel invasion, an infiltrative invasive pattern, and invasion into at least the muscle layer (pT2,3,4 v pT1). The expression of ST-3 in frankly invasive tumors was associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Its expression in a small subgroup of pTa lesions may be indirect evidence that some tumors diagnosed as pTa have invasive potential.														0046-8177		10.1053/hupa.2000.8447																		J	BCI:BCI200000380515	10930109			Carcinoma in situ of the breast: Correlation of histopathology to immunohistochemical markers and DNA ploidy		Ottesen, Gyda Lolk; Christensen, Ib Jarle; Larsen, Jorgen K.; Larsen, Jacob; Baldetorp, Bo; Linden, Thomas; Hansen, Bodil; Andersen, Johan									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2000	April, 2000	60	3	219-226	219	226							In a consecutive and unselected series of 178 cases of carcinoma in situ of the breast (CIS), comprising both ductal (DCIS) and lobular type (LCIS), and a series of 48 cases of invasive carcinoma (IC) with predominance of DCIS, the association between histopathology, immunohistochemical markers (ER, PgR, MIB-1, c-erbB-2, and p53), and DNA ploidy was investigated, in order to discriminate biologically different groups. In DCIS, significant correlation was shown between large nuclear size and comedonecrosis, both of which showed also strong association to DNA aneuploidy, high proliferation activity, low steroid receptor content, and overexpression of c-erbB-2 and p53 - factors that may indicate an aggressive behavior. Small nuclear CIS, whether LCIS or DCIS, on the contrary, were DNA diploid with low proliferation, and no cases showed overexpression of c-erbB-2 and p53. Heterogeneity with respect to the investigated parameters was also a frequent finding that may reflect a development complexity. In IC, comparison of the DCIS and the invasive component showed similar patterns. No significant differences were shown between DCIS without and with invasion. This may indicate that none of the investigated parameters on its own are essential for the event of invasion.														0167-6806		10.1023/A:1006453420088																		J	BCI:BCI200000250026				Molecular cytogenetic comparison of apocrine metaplasia and apocrine carcinoma of the breast		Jones, C.; Damiani, S.; Wells, D.; Eusebi, V.; Lakhani, S.

American Journal of Pathology		2000	January, 2000	156	1	183-191	183	191							The p53 tumor suppressor gene is altered in approximately half of human cancers. Although p53 mutations are common in invasive breast carcinoma, few have been identified in breast carcinoma in situ (intraductal breast carcinomas). Most studies of p53 in breast carcinoma in situ are immunohistochemical studies of p53 staining in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Few studies have isolated the tumor cells and subjected them to DNA sequence analysis. The current study was undertaken to characterize p53 in a cohort of breast carcinoma in situ cases, both with and without invasive disease. Fifty-eight frozen breast biopsy samples were used for these investigations. Twenty-seven cases had only ductal carcinoma in situ (CIS) and 31 cases had evidence of both invasive and in situ carcinoma. DNA sequence alterations in exons 2 through 11 of p53 were screened by the single-strand conformational polymorphism technique. Exons with altered mobility were sequenced. Among breast CIS cases without invasive disease, 22% had p53 mutations and 7% had DNA sequence alterations of unknown significance. Analysis of breast CIS with concurrent invasive disease demonstrated p53 mutations in 19% of cases and one (3%) DNA alteration of unknown significance. Each carcinoma having a p53 mutation in the breast CIS component had the identical mutation in the invasive component of the same tumor indicating a clonal relationship between the two tumor components. p53 protein overexpression was identified in 22% of pure intraductal breast carcinomas and in 35% of breast CIS with invasive disease. Comparison of immunostaining and DNA sequence alterations showed a significant association between overexpression and mutations (P = 0.0037) in cases of CIS without invasion, and similarly between overexpression and mutations in cases of CIS with invasion (P = 0.007). p53 mutations and p53 overexpression were relatively common in intraductal breast carcinomas but were not observed in adjacent normal breast lobules or ducts in 9 cases available for DNA analysis. The frequency of p53 alterations when comparing breast CIS with and without an invasive component indicated that p53 mutations usually occur before invasion during the progression of breast cancer, as is observed for a number of other adult solid tumors.														0002-9440		10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64718-9																		J	BCI:BCI200000423425	11007434			Heterogeneous chromosomal aberrations in intraductal breast lesions adjacent to invasive carcinoma		Aubele, Michaela; Cummings, Margaret; Walch, Axel; Zitzelsberger, Horst; Naehrig, Joerg; Hoefler, Heinz; Werner, Martin									Analytical Cellular Pathology		2000		20	1	17-24	17	24										Walch, Axel/B-4554-2012; cummings, margaret/B-5747-2011	Walch, Axel/0000-0001-5578-4023;										0921-8912		10.1155/2000/930246																		J	BCI:BCI200000165127				Carcinomas in situ (CIS) of the breast with indeterminate features: Role of E-cadherin (e-cad) staining in categorization		Jacobs, T.

In a study base including all 4661 women registered to the Swedish Cancer Registry for a first carcinoma in situ between 1960 and 1992, we selected a cohort of 3398 women diagnosed between 1980 and 1992. The recruitment period was chosen according to the reporting routines for the registry. The corrected survival was 97.4% after 10 years. The risk of invasive cancer was similar in the ipsilateral and contralateral breast. Women diagnosed between 1989 and 1992 ran a relative risk of 0.1 (95% confidence interval, 0.0-0.9) of dying of breast cancer, as compared with women diagnosed from 1980-1982. Residence in counties where mammography screening was available was associated with a relative risk of 0.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.0-2.1) for breast cancer death in the age groups screened. Screening mammography may have contributed to the improvement of prognosis over this time period. This study cannot distinguish between lead time effects and a "true" improvement in prognosis. The increased use of breast conservation was not associated with a worse prognosis in the group as a whole. The study indicates that at least 50% of invasive cancers occurring after treatment for in situ lesions may be new cancers.														1055-9965																				J	BCI:BCI199900474417				Expression of p27kip1 protein in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast		Oh, Y.

Setting: In this area, since the seventies, a mammographic screening by personal invitation was performed by the Center for Cancer Prevention (CSPO) in some rural municipalities. After 1990, the municipality of Florence and other municipalities were involved in the screening. Methods: The study included all cases of female breast carcinomas in situ reported to the population-based Tuscany Cancer Registry between 1985 and 1995. On the basis of information from the CSPO files, the cases were categorized into: "screen-detected", "self-referrals", and "other" (CSPO cases diagnosed in symptomatic women or at periodic check up after breast cancer plus hospital cases). Results: Overall, 332 women with breast carcinoma in situ (CIS) were registered between 1985 and 1995. The CIS incidence rate increased from 2.39/100,000 women in 1985-87 to 6.22/100,000 in 1994-95. The largest increase was observed for the ductal carcinoma in situ (2.9 times) and in women aged 50-69 years (3.8 times). In this age group, cases diagnosed at the screening by personal invitation accounted for 69% of the rise in CIS incidence. The proportion of mastectomy lowered from 41% before 1990 to 25% after 1990. Conclusion: In the Florence area the CIS incidence trend, showing a marked increase beginning in 1991, was mainly explained by the spread of the mammographic screening by personal invitation. The period during which mammographic screening became widespread coincided with a change in the treatment policy of breast cancer, with a high proportion of breast conserving surgery also for CIS. Therefore, the rise in CIS incidence rates correlated with the widespread use of mammographic screening did not substantially increase the number of women treated by mastectomy.														0957-5243		10.1023/A:1008992903478																		J	BCI:BCI199900321083	10362362			Telomerase activity in ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer		Umbricht, C.

Oncogene		1999	June 3, 1999	18	22	3407-3414	3407	3414							The increasing number of breast carcinoma in situ detected by screening procedures makes it imperative to develop improved markers to stratify the risk of invasive cancer. Telomerase is detectable in invasive cancer, but not in normal tissues. We have microdissected frozen tissue blocks containing both DCIS and invasive cancer to assay the telomerase activity of these two lesions. The 46 available cases of concurrent DCIS and invasive breast cancer resulted in 43 DCIS samples and 38 invasive cancer samples adequate for analysis. Seventy per cent of the DCIS and all invasive cancer samples tested had detectable telomerase activity. In addition, we analysed telomerase activity in ten cases of DCIS that were not associated with invasive cancer, and detected telomerase activity in seven (70%). Mixing experiments showed no evidence of telomerase inhibitors in telomerase negative samples. Furthermore, periductal inflammatory infiltrates were shown to be a potential confounding source of telomerase activity. Since DCIS lesions appear to be heterogeneous with respect to telomerase activity, and telomerase activation appears to precede the development of invasive cancer, telomerase activity may be a useful adjunct in stratifying the risk of developing invasive breast cancer in patients with DCIS.														0950-9232		10.1038/sj.onc.1202714																		J	BCI:BCI199900103453	10091735			Predictors of local recurrence after treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ:A meta-analysis		Boyages, John; Delaney, Geoff; Taylor, Richard									Cancer		1999	Feb. 1, 1999	85	3	616-628	616	628							BACKGROUND. Management of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a dilemma, as mastectomy provides nearly a 100% cure rate but at the expense of physical and psychologic morbidity. It would be helpful if we could predict which patients with DCIS are at sufficiently high risk of local recurrence after conservative surgery (CS) alone to wan-ant postoperative radiotherapy (FM and which patients are at sufficient risk of local recurrence after CS + RT to warrant mastectomy. The authors reviewed the published studies and identified the factors that may be predictive of local recurrence after management by mastectomy, CS alone, or CS + RT. METHODS. The authors examined patient, tumor, and treatment factors as potential predictors for local recurrence and estimated the risks of recurrence based on a review of published studies. They examined the effects of patient factors (age at diagnosis and family history), tumor factors (sub-type of DCIS, grade, tumor size, necrosis, and margins), and treatment (mastectomy, CS alone, and CS + RT). The 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the recurrence rates for each of the studies were calculated for subtype, grade, and necrosis, using the exact binomial; the summary recurrence rate and 95% CI for each treatment category were calculated by quantitative meta-analysis using the fixed and random effects models applied to proportions. RESULTS. Meta-analysis yielded a summary recurrence rate of 22.5% (95% CI 16.9-28.2) for studies employing CS alone, 8.9% (95% CI = 6.8-11.0) for CS + RT, and 1.4% (95% CI = 0.7-2.1) for studies involving mastectomy alone. These summary figures indicate a clear and statistically significant separation, and therefore outcome, between the recurrence rates of each treatment category, despite the likelihood that the patients who underwent CS alone were likely to have had smaller, possibly low grade lesions with clear margins. The patients with risk factors of presence of necrosis, high grade cytologic features, or comedo subtype were found to derive the greatest improvement in local control with the addition of RT to CS. Local recurrence among patients treated by CS alone is approximately 20%, and one-half of the recurrences are invasive cancers. For most patients, RT reduces the risk of recurrence after CS alone by at least 50%. The differences in local recurrence between CS alone and CS + RT are most apparent for those patients with high grade tumors or DCIS with necrosis, or of the "comedo" subtype, or DCIS with close or positive surgical margins. CONCLUSIONS. The authors recommend that radiation be added to CS if patients with DCIS who also have the risk factors for local recurrence choose breast conservation over mastectomy. The patients who may be suitable for CS alone outside of a clinical trial may be those who have low grade lesions with little or no necrosis, and with clear surgical margins. Use of the summary statistics when discussing outcomes with patients may help the patient make treatment decisions.														0008-543X		10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990201)85:3<616::AID-CNCR12>3.0.CO;2-7																		J	BCI:BCI199800349110	9663590			Parity, age at first birth and the risk of carcinoma in situ of the breast		Lambe, Mats; Hsieh, Chung-Cheng; Tsaih, Shirng-Wern; Ekbom, Anders; Trichopoulos, Dimitrios; Adami, Hans-Olov									International Journal of Cancer		1998	July 29, 1998	77	3	330-332	330	332							Epidemiological studies of in situ breast cancer are sparse, and the role of reproductive history, an established risk modifier for invasive breast cancer, remains incompletely investigated. To examine possible associations with parity and age at first birth, we undertook a case-control study nested in a nationwide cohort of Swedish women. The reproductive history of 1,368 women aged 65 or younger with a diagnosis of carcinoma in situ of the breast were compared with that of 6,837 age-matched controls drawn randomly from a population-based Fertility Registry. Statistical analyses were performed by conditional logistic regression. Compared to nulliparous women, ever-parous women were at a reduced risk of carcinoma in situ of the breast. The risk decreased with number of live births, with the estimated risk reduction in the highest parity group (5+), being of the same magnitude as that reported for invasive breast cancer. By contrast, a positive association with increasing age at first birth was somewhat less pronounced than that observed previously in the same data set with respect to invasive breast cancer. Our findings indicate that parity affects the risk of invasive breast cancer and carcinoma in situ similarly, whereas the effect of age at first birth appears to be weaker for the risk of carcinoma in situ.

To provide population-based estimates of invasive breast cancer risk following CIS, we linked data on 249 incident primary CIS (median age 53 years) to the Cancer Registry of the Swiss Canton of Vaud (about 600,000 inhabitants) over the period 1977-1994. Women with concurrent invasive cancers of the breast were not included. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were determined according to the exact Poisson distribution, with stratification for age and year of diagnosis. A total of 24 cases of breast cancer vs. 3.4 expected (SIR = 7.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.6-10.6), and 7 cases of other neoplasms (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) vs. 6.9 expected (SIR = 1.0, 95% CI: 0.4-2.1) were observed. The SIR was 10.4 during the first year, 5.6 between 1 and 4 years, and 7.7 after gtoreq5 years after CIS diagnosis. SIRs were consistent in women below and above age 55 years, but somewhat higher for ductal (SIR = 8.6) than lobular (SIR = 4.2) CIS. Six deaths from breast cancer were observed vs. 1.5 expected (standardized mortality ratio = 4.0, 95% CI: 1.5-8.7). In 13/19 ductal CIS, but in 2/4 lobular CIS, invasive cancer occurred in the same breast. In most women, CIS and subsequent invasive cancer showed the same morphological (i.e., ductal or lobular) features. The cumulative risk of breast cancer was 16% 10 years after CIS diagnosis, emphasizing the importance of adequate surveillance of women after CIS of the breast.			franceschi, silvia/M-2452-2014	franceschi, silvia/0000-0003-4181-8071										0020-7136		10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19980729)77:3<392::AID-IJC14>3.0.CO;2-A																		J	BCI:BCI199800349206	9622698			Breast carcinoma in situ in a male: Report of a case diagnosed by nipple discharge cytology		Lopez-Rios, Fernando; Vargas-Castrillon, Javier; Gonzalez-Palacios, Fernando; De Agustin, Pedro P.

Cytologic evaluation of abnormal nipple secretion is a well-established method for the rapid diagnosis of breast carcinoma in females. However, less attention has been focused on male patients presenting with nipple discharge. Case: A case of intraductal carcinoma of the male breast was diagnosed by nipple discharge cytology alone. This report illustrates the usefulness of nipple discharge cytology in the diagnosis of early breast carcinoma in males.														0001-5547		10.1159/000331837																		J	BCI:BCI199800365223	9674874			Biological profile of in situ breast cancer investigated by immunohistochemical technique		Albonico, Giuseppe; Querzoli, Patrizia; Ferretti, Stefano; Rinaldi, Rosa; Nenci, Italo									Cancer Detection and Prevention		1998		22	4	313-318	313	318							In 74 in situ breast cancers an immunohistochemical study for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors, proliferation index (PI), and c-erbB-2, p53, and bcl-2 overexpression was performed. Cases were categorized as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) comedo: 24.3% of cases; DCIS non comedo: 27% of cases; DCIS cribriform: 5.4% of cases; lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS): 16.3% of cases; mixed carcinoma in situ: 27% of cases. Quantitation of immunohistochemical results was obtained with an image analysis computerized system (CAS 200). The cutoff values used were: 10% of positive area for ER, PR, NEU, and bcl-2; 5% of positive area for p53; 13% of PI for proliferative activity. DCIS cribriform and LCIS displayed a higher positivity for ER (92.6 and 93.8% of cases); DCIS cribriform and DCIS non comedo a higher for PR (89 and 75.3%); DCIS comedo presented the highest values for PI (65.4%), NEU (72.8%), and p53 expression (37.3%). All DCIS cribriform and DCIS non comedo and 99.6% of LCIS expressed bcl-2.

European Journal of Cancer		1997		33	1	96-100	96	100							A rapid increase of female breast cancer has been reported in many areas of the world and the reasons are not fully understood. While some have attributed the increase to the increasing detection of early stage breast cancer through mammography screening, few studies have directly examined the time trend of in situ breast cancer specifically. This study included all incident cases of female breast carcinoma in situ reported to the Connecticut Tumor Registry between 1973 and 1992. The age-adjusted incidence rates and age-specific incidence rates were calculated by histology and by race. The age-adjusted incidence rates were standardized to the 1970 United States standard million population. The study found that the overall age-adjusted incidence rate of in situ breast cancer has increased dramatically, from 3.53/100 000 in 1973-1975 to 17.51/100 000 in 1991-1992. The increase was not uniform during the past two decades of cancer registration. In fact, most of the observed rise has occurred since the early 1980s. This increase was found in both Caucasians and Blacks. The results by histology indicate that the dramatic increase in carcinoma in situ is mostly attributable to an increase in ductal carcinoma in situ. The increase was also observed in all age groups 40 years and over. These results are consistent with the use pattern and the reported effect of mammography screening. Therefore, these results are qualitatively consistent with the idea that mammography screening is largely responsible for the recent upsurge in female breast cancer incidence in this population. The study also found that the age group 40-49 years in whites experienced a rapid increase in incidence that began in the same time period as the older age groups, but it has since levelled off. The potential impact of the highly publicised debate regarding the efficacy of mammography in this age group in recent years is discussed.

Amplification of areas on 10p, 8q and 20q were also observed. Chromosomal alterations were more frequent in higher grade DCIS and closely resemble those previously detected in invasive breast cancer using the same technique.

The quantitation of immunohistochemical results was obtained with an image analysis computerized system (CAS 200) with a lesion-field method; tumors were subdivided in fields (1177) histologically homogeneous, with 40 x microscopic objective. For ER, PR, Neu and p53, 10% of the positive area was used as cut-off value; 13% was used for PI. Cribriform and lobular types showed a higher positivity for ER (92.1% and 95.5% of the fields); cribriform and papillary a higher for PR (92.6% and 93.9%). Comedo variant demonstrated the higher PI (52.7%), Neu and p53 expression (67.7% and 43%). A cluster analysis, performed on 608 fields, defined two groups according to biological homogeneous criteria.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization can be used to analyse the genetics of breast-cancer progression by interphase cytogenetics. We have analysed the histological distribution of erbB2 and topoll-alpha co-amplification in paraffin sections of invasive breast cancer and show that the co-amplified loci share the same histological distribution in the tumour and have a similar nuclear distribution within individual nuclei. Regions of the tumours without amplification are easily recognized and tumours with erbB2 and topoll-alpha co-amplification can be distinguished from those with erbB2 amplification alone. In addition, FISH was used to show polysomy of chromosome 17 in non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast and erbB2 amplification in both the invasive and non-invasive components of a breast cancer biopsy.

Methods: The polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridisation were used to detect EBV genome. The number and distribution of T and B lymphocytes were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Results: Histologically all of the patients had poorly differentiated tumours. Immunohistochemistry showed that T cells predominated in three cases, B cell in two, and almost equal numbers in one case. PCR showed that the EBV genome was present in two cases each of gastric and breast carcinoma. In situ hybridisation for EBV genome provided positive signals only in the small lymphoid cells in one gastric and two breast carcinomas giving a positive reaction for EBV genome by PCR. The gastric and breast cancer cells did not give positive signals. Conclusion: Severe lymphoid cell infiltration in gastric and breast carcinoma does not necessarily indicate that these tumours are associated with EBV. Larger numbers of cases will need to be studied to confirm this.														0021-9746		10.1136/jcp.47.6.538																		J	BCI:BCI199497301483				Allelotype of breast carcinoma in situ from paraffin sections, correlation with chromosome copy number		Chen, T.; Dhingra, K.; Brenner, A.; Sahin, A.; Sniege, N.; Vogel, V.; Hortobagyi, G.

Journal of the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda)		1993		85	9	727-731	727	731							Background: Mortality associated with human breast carcinoma is almost entirely due to subsequent metastatic disease, but the molecular basis of this metastasis is not understood. Elucidation of the genetic control of metastatic propensity of a tumor is important in determining prognosis and choice of therapy. Expression of nm23, a putative metastasis suppressor gene, has been detected in human breast cancers, but studies have not consistently shown high levels of the Nm23 messenger RNA or protein to be associated with better histological differentiation. This inconsistency suggests that Nm23 protein may act independently as a metastasis suppressor. Purpose: The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the relationship of Nm23 protein expression with 1) histology in ductal breast carcinoma in situ and 2) the variables considered to be the major prognostic indicators in invasive breast carcinoma. Methods: We obtained formalin-fixed biopsy specimens of breast tissue excised from 128 patients with breast lesions detected by mammography. Of these patients, 35 had been diagnosed with benign breast disease, 26 with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and 67 with invasive carcinoma. Tissue sections were embedded in paraffin blocks, and immunohistochemical staining was used to determine Nm23 expression. Specimens were rated positive if all lesional epithelium was stained and negative if any lesional epithelium was unstained. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple regression analysis because of nonorthogonality of the data. Results: All 35 examples of benign breast disease showed uniform epithelial cell staining. The seven cases of comedo DCIS were negative for Nm23 protein; all 18 noncomedo types were positive. Nm23 negativity was significantly associated with worsening invasive ductal carcinoma grade and advancing lymph node stage but not with tumor diameter or vascular invasion. Despite the putative antimetastatic role of the nm23 gene, no statistically significant association was found between Nm23 protein expression and vascular invasion. Conclusions: The precise role of the nm23 gene remains to be established, but out simplified immunohistochemical rating system shows an association between Nm23 protein expression and the two most significant prognostic factors relating to histologic grade and stage. Nm23 negativity distinguished comedo ductal carcinoma in situ from the other histological types, a finding consistent with the fact that comedo histology is known to have a higher likelihood of becoming invasive and of having higher cell proliferation rates and higher expression of growth factor (c-erb B2) receptor.														0027-8874		10.1093/jnci/85.9.727																		J	BCI:BCI199396018766	8097877			Estrogen and progesterone receptor and c-erbB-2 oncoprotein analysis in pure in situ breast carcinoma: An immunohistochemical study		Wilbur, David C.; Barrows, George H.									Modern Pathology		1993		6	2	114-120	114	120							The authors studied 30 consecutive archival cases of pure breast carcinoma in situ (CIS) for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and c-erbB-2 oncogene product. Clinical factors of age and menstrual status and histologic features of tumor type and nuclear grade were determined. Some 77% represented ductal CIS, with 10% noninvasive papillary, and 13% lobular CIS. A total of 22 of 30 (73%) were ER+ and 19 (63%) were PR+; 24 (80%) were c-erbB-2+ with 11 (37%) showing strong staining; 75% of the ER-PR group had tumors of NG-3, versus 14% for the ER+PR+ plus ER+PR- groups. Nonstatistically significant trends correlating the strongly positive oncogene group with PM status, receptor negativity, and high nuclear grade were noted. The overall rate of receptor positivity, as well as the correlation with nuclear grade, is similar to that in invasive carcinomas c-erbB-2 protein expression shows a higher rate in in situ than is reported for invasive tumors, and shows a tendency to be expressed more strongly in tumors with other features of poor prognosis. Therefore, these factors may also have prognostic significance in CIS. Continued followup of this population to recurrence may provide further insight.														0893-3952																				J	BCI:BCI199344061483				Risk of contralateral primary breast cancer following a diagnosis of breast carcinoma in situ		Habel, L.

Anticancer Research		1992		12	6B	2113-2115	2113	2115							In contrast to the situation in invasive breast carcinoma, there are only few reports on the levels of receptors for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR) in pre-invasive (in situ) breast carcinoma. In the present study ER and PgR levels were analyzed in 57 in situ human mammary carcinomas using a quantitative enzyme immunoassay method. Intraductal carcinoma was the dominating histopathological subgroup (75%). Within this subgroup the non-comedo and comedo variants comprised 66 and 34 percent respectively. Intralobular and papillary in situ subtypes were the second most frequent subgroups, representing 11% each. Using a cut-off level of 0.05 fmole/mu-g DNA to define receptor poor and rich tumors we found that thirty-one out of the 57 cases (54%) were ER-rich. In the ER-rich tumors the receptor levels varied between 0.05 and 6.50 fmole/mu-g with a mean concentration of 0.80 fmole/mu-g DNA. Fifteen of 51 (30%) tumors were classified as PgR-rich tumors in which the levels ranged between 0.05 and 2.90 fmoles/mu-g DNA, with a mean concentration of 0.45 fmoles/mu-g DNA. Two thirds of the non-comedo, lobular and papillary variant were ER rich. A majority (80%) of comedo tumors were ER poor. Our findings show that 54% of in situ breast carcinomas have the molecular prerequisities for response to antiestrogen therapy which is of interest when planning adjuvant treatment protocols.														0250-7005																				J	BCI:BCI199294133888	1329232			BREAST CARCINOMA-IN-SITU AN EMERGING PROBLEM IN SINGAPORE		CHUA C L; TAN P K; CHIANG G; SOO K C; LOW C H									SMJ Singapore Medical Journal		1992		33	4	383-385	383	385							Breast carcinoma-in-situ constitutes 4.1% of 707 breast cancers diagnosed between 1988 and 1990.

A significant association was found between high TLI and positive staining. Twenty of the 70 cases stained (29%) and of those that were stained 75% had a high TLI; 43% of those with a high TLI stained positively but only 14% of those with a low TLI stained positively. Strong correlations were seen between nuclear size and histological pattern and both 21N staining and TLI. The majority of carcinomas of comedo pattern with large nuclei were 21N positive and had a high TLI, whilst those with small nuclei and a predominantly cribriform/micropapillary appearance did not stain and had a low TLI. In tumours of mixed histological pattern there was less concordance between staining and TLI.

Relatively few studies have attempted to characterize ER pattern in breast carcinoma in situ (CIS) and in other premalignant lesions. In the current study, the authors investigated the pattern of ER expression in 62 cases of breast CIS, 30 of which had a component of invasive cancer, and 36 cases of atypical hyperplasia. Paraffin sections of formalin-fixed breast tissue underwent enzyme pretreatment ot expose nulcear antigenic sites as previously described. Breast tissues then underwent estrogen immunocytochemical assay using specific monoclonal antibodies (Abbott Laboratory, Chicago, IL). The cases were evaluated for heterogeneity, intensity of staining, and percentage of ER-positive cells. An attempt was made to study the relation between the pattern of ER expression, nuclearpleomorphism, and type of CIS. The results of ER immunocytochemical assay showed positive nuclear staining for ER in 75% of the CIS, 73% of CIS with invasive cancer, and 100% of atypical hyperplasias. ER expression in CIS agreed with that in the invasive carcinoma in 29 of 30 cases. This study also suggests that comedocarcinoma has a higher incidence of negative ER expression than the other types of CIS, particularly when it is associated with significant nuclear pleomorphism. There was no significant differnce in ER tumor heterogeneity between premalignant and malignant lesions.														0002-9173		10.1093/ajcp/94.5.533																		J	BCI:BCI199140026594				ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINING FOR C-ERPB-2 PROTEIN IN BREAST CARCINOMA IN-SITU		BARNES D M; MEYER J S; GONZALEZ J G; GULLICK W J; MILLIS R R									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		1990		16	2	183	183																						0167-6806																				J	BCI:BCI199089106319	2315215			STROMAL CHANGES IN EARLY INVASIVE BREAST CARCINOMA AN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL HISTOENZYMOLOGICAL AND ULTRASTRUCTURAL STUDY		CHOMETTE G; TRANBALOC M A P; BLONDON J									Pathology Research and Practice		1990		186	1	70-79	70	79							The purpose of this work was to detect in periductal connective tissue of breast carcinoma in situ changes induced by intraductal tumor cells before any debiscence in basement membrane. Histological, electron microscopic, immunohistochemical and histoenzymological methods were used in 3 carcinomas in situ, 4 microinvasive carcinomas and 13 control invasive carcinomas. We could demonstrate a high functional activity of fibroblasts with secretion of mucopolysaccharides and type III collagen around intraductal carcinomas. These changes occurred simultaneously to those of the basement membrane which was either thinning or thickening. Any dehiscence in basement membrane secondarily induced in this periductal stroma the usual changes seen in invasive stroma, peculiarly numerous vascular pedicles, myofibroblasts, elastic material. These periductal stromal changes are interpreted according to recent concepts about the possible influence of tumor cells upon their environment: stimulation of mitotic and metabolic activity of fibroblasts: stimulation of angiogenesis by means of an angiogenic factor.														0344-0338		10.1016/S0344-0338(11)81012-5																		J	BCI:BCI198936075868	2535929			BREAST CARCINOMA IN SITU		KINNE D W; PETREK J A; OSBORNE M P; FRACCHIA A A; DEPALO A A; ROSEN P P									Archives of Surgery		1989		124	1	33-36	33	36																					0004-0010																				J	BCI:BCI199089027444	2775553			SERUM LEVELS OF VITAMIN A E C AND CAROTENOIDS IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS AND IN SUBJECTS WITH BREAST NEOPLASMS		AUDISIO M; MASTROIACOVA P; MARTINOLI L; FIDANZA A; CAPPELLI L; PASQUALI LASAGNI R; TIRELLI C; JACOBELLI G									Bollettino Societa Italiana Biologia Sperimentale		1989		65	5	473-480	473	480							Serum values of retinol, carotenoids, tocopherol and ascorbic acid were assayed in healthy adult females (Group A: 20 cases) and in subjects with fibrocistic mastopathy (Group B: 20 cases), benign breast neoplasms, as fibroadenomas and intraductal papillomas (Group C: 18 cases), and breast carcinoma in situ (Group D: 36 cases). Retinol and carotenoids were evaluated by spectrophotometry using trifluoroacetic acid. Tocopherol was determined by a colorimetric method involving the reduction of Fe+++ to Fe++ by tocopherol with the formation of a red complex of the Fe=+ with .alpha.,.alpha.'-dipirydyl. Ascorbic acid was estimated by a colorimetric method after derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Our results point out that there is a highly significant decrease (p < 0.001) of average retinal serum levels in all three patient groups as compared with group A, whereas carotenoids resulted decreased but not significantly. Tocopherol was found to be significantly lower only in groups B (p < 0.05) and D (p < 0.01), ascorbic acid in groups B (p < 0.01) C (p < 0.05) and D (p < 0.001).														0037-8771																				J	BCI:BCI198171068112				THE OBSTETRIC FUTURE OF CANCER PATIENTS AFTER TREATMENT		CAPPELAERE P; QUERLEU D									Gynecologie		1980		31	4	329-341	329	341							The fertility of women previously treated for cancer cannot be precisely assessed. Many pregnancies progress normally after treatment of a choriocarcinoma, Hodgkin's disease, a carcinoma of the breast, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or a carcinoma or leukemia during childhood. Abortions and congenital malformations are no more common, despite the previous treatment. The probability of recurrence is not affected by pregnancy. The child nevertheless remains exposed to a mutagenic risk, which is impossible to determine at the present time but which is probably modest. Various measures may be used to protect reproductive functions without compromising the results of treatment. At present, sterilization is indicated when pregnancy is definitively contraindicated, and contraception when there is a temporary contraindication. Therapeutic abortion is not medically necessary in the absence of recurrence. The cryopreservation of ova and ovarian transplantation could in certain cases improve the quality of survival in cured cancer patients.														0301-2204
