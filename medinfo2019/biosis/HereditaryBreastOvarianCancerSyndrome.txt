The following study investigates the prevalence and type of BRCA mutations in Chinese patients with high hereditary risk of breast cancer (BC). Patients Drwere recruited from 14 cities between October 2015 and February 2016, and were selected based on family and personal medical history. BRCA mutations were analyzed by collecting blood samples from all participants. 437 BC patients were included. A total of seventy-six (17.4%) mutation carriers were identified with no geographic difference. The mutation rate in the early-onset BC patients was lower compared to family history of breast/ovarian cancer (OC), bilateral BC, male BC, BC&OC or meeting >= 2 criteria (9.2 vs. 21.7, 24.0, 22.2, 16.7 and 24.3%, respectively, P=0.007). A total of 61 mutation sites were identified (BRCA1 32, BRCA2 29) including 47.5% novel sites and extra 10 variants of uncertain significance. A total of five sites were repeated in more than one unrelated patient. A total of 11 sites were associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, two of which were confirmed by family pedigrees. Compared with BRCA-patients, patients with BRCA1 mutation tended to be triple-negative BC (P<0.001), whereas patients with BRCA2 mutation were more likely to be hormone receptor positive BC (P=0.02). The present study provides a general BRCA mutation profile in the Chinese population. The prevalence of BRCA mutation in BC patients with high hereditary risk is lower compared with Western populations. Chinese mutation type is different with Western people, without obvious founder mutation.														1792-1074	1792-1082	10.3892/ol.2018.8538

In the present study, a mutation analysis of these genes was performed on non BRCA1/2 families. RAD51C and RAD51D genes were analyzed in 141 and 77 families, respectively. The analysis included direct sequencing and multiple ligation probe analysis. The RAD51C pathogenic variant c.404G > A was identified in a breast and ovarian cancer family (0.7%), while the RAD51D pathogenic variant c.694C > T was described in an ovarian cancer family (1.3%). Moreover, three unknown clinical significance variants were detected: c.307T > G in RAD51C, and c.413A > G and c.715C > T in RAD51D. No large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) were found. RAD51D carriers suffered from premenopausal ovarian tumors. These results increase our knowledge about the RAD51C and RAD51D mutation spectrum and support the notion that these genes should be included in the gene panel testing performed on patients with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.

J	BCI:BCI201800430349	29659587			Can chimerism explain breast/ovarian cancers in BRCA non-carriers from BRCA-positive families?		Mitchell, Rachel; Buckingham, Lela; Cobleigh, Melody; Rotmensch, Jacob; Burgess, Kelly; Usha, Lydia (Lydia_usha@rush.edu)									PLoS One		2018	APR 16 2018	13	4	Article No.: e0195497	e0195497								Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) is most frequently caused by mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (in short, BRCA) genes. The incidence of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in relatives of BRCA mutation carriers who test negative for the familial mutation (non-carriers) may be increased. However, the data is controversial, and at this time, these individuals are recommended the same cancer surveillance as general population. One possible explanation for BRCA phenocopies (close relatives of BRCA carriers who have developed cancer consistent with HBOC but tested negative for a familial mutation) is natural chimerism where lack of detectable mutation in blood may not rule out the presence of the mutation in the other tissues. To test this hypothesis, archival tumor tissue from eleven BRCA phenocopies was investigated. DNA from the tumor tissue was analyzed using sequence-specific PCR, capillary electrophoresis, and pyrosequencing. The familial mutations were originally detected in the patients' first-degree relatives by commercial testing. The same testing detected no mutations in the blood of the patients under study. The test methods targeted only the known familial mutation in the tumor tissue. Tumor diagnoses included breast, ovarian, endometrial and primary peritoneal carcinoma. None of the familial mutations were found in the tumor samples tested. These results do not support, but do not completely exclude, the possibility of chimerism in these patients. Further studies with comprehensive sequence analysis in a larger patient group are warranted as a chimeric state would further refine the predictive value of genetic testing to include BRCA phenocopies.														1932-6203	1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0195497

Both genes function in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway of the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair process. Therefore, the DNA-repair defect characteristic of cancer cells brings about a therapeutic advantage for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor-induced synthetic lethality. PARP inhibitor-based therapeutics initially cause cancer lethality but acquired resistance mechanisms have been found and need to be elucidated. In particular, it is essential to understand in detail the mechanism of DNA damage and repair to PARP inhibitor treatment. Further investigations have shown the roles of BRCA1/2 and its associations to other molecules in the DSB repair system. Notably, the repair pathway chosen in BRCA1-deficient cells could be entirely different from that in BRCA2-deficient cells after PARP inhibitor treatment. The present review describes synthetic lethality and acquired resistance mechanisms to PARP inhibitor through the DSB repair pathway and subsequent repair process. In addition, recent knowledge of resistance mechanisms is discussed. Our model should contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.														1349-7006	1349-7006	10.1111/cas.13530

(joseph.rabban@ucsf.edu)									Pathology		2018	FEB 2018	50	2	238-256	238	256							The most common hereditary gynaecological tumour syndromes are hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and Lynch syndrome. However, pathologists also may encounter gynaecological tumours in women with rare hereditary syndromes. Many of these tumours exhibit distinctive gross and microscopic features that are associated with a risk for an inherited gene mutation. The sensitivity and specificity of these tumour pathology features for predicting an inherited mutation vary depending on the syndrome. By recognising these tumour features, pathologists may potentially contribute to the diagnosis of an unsuspected syndrome by recommending referral of the patient for formal risk assessment by genetic counselling. Patients additionally benefit from diagnosis of an inherited syndrome because many also carry a lifetime risk for developing primary malignancies outside of the gynaecological tract. Early diagnosis of an inherited syndrome permits early screening, detection, and management of additional malignancies associated with the syndrome. This review highlights these rare syndromes and their tumour pathology, including Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (gastric type mucinous carcinoma of the cervix; ovarian sex cord tumour with annular tubules); hereditary leiomyoma renal cell carcinoma syndrome (uterine leiomyoma); tuberous sclerosis complex (uterine PEComa; uterine lymphangioleiomyomatosis); DICER1 syndrome (ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour; cervical embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma); rhabdoid tumour predisposition syndrome 2 (small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcaemic type); Cowden syndrome (endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma); naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (ovarian fibroma); and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (clear cell papillary cystadenoma of the broad ligament).														0031-3025	1465-3931	10.1016/j.pathol.2017.10.009

The detection of pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants is essential for the diagnosis and prevention of HBOC, and for offering treatment decisions for patients. Therefore, there is a growing demand for the development of accurate, rapid assay systems that simultaneously detect pathogenic variants and copy number alterations. Here, we tested Thermo Fisher Scientific's newly developed Oncomine (R) BRCA1/2 Panel. We showed that all mutations in standard reference DNA were detected with high accuracy, and that values of allelic fractions were detected with high concordance (R-2 = 0.9986). The Oncomine (R) BRCA1/2 Panel detected 21 pathogenic germline variants in 147 patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer, of which 20 were detected by the previously-launched Ion AmpliSeq T BRCA1/2 Panel, except for one frameshift mutation. The Oncomine (R) BRCA1/2 Panel precisely captured one additional frameshift mutation, which is difficult to detect because of the homopolymer site. Large genomic deletion was identified in one sample, which was previously detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Oncomine (R) BRCA1/2 Panel could accurately detect pathogenic variant and copy number alteration, and be an alternative assay to investigate BRCA1/2 germline and somatic mutations.														1949-2553	1949-2553	10.18632/oncotarget.22962

Triple-negative (TN) breast cancer (BC) shares histological characteristics with germline BRCA1 mutation-associated tumours. We have investigated the metabolic profiles of human breast cancer (BC) cell lines carrying BRCA1 pathogenic mutations by non-targeted liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry technology. Based on our in vitro results, we performed a targeted metabolomic analysis of plasma samples from TN HBOC patients taking into account their BRCA1 genotype. BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation and the BRCAness phenotype of BC cell lines were also studied. The purpose of this study was to determine the metabolic signature of HBOC syndrome and TNBC patients and to evaluate the potential contribution of the metabolites identified to the genetic diagnosis of breast cancer. The present results show the existence of a differential metabolic signature for BC cells based on the BRCA1 functionality. None of the studied BC cell lines presented hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter region. We provide evidence of the existence of free methylated nucleotides capable of distinguishing plasma samples from HBOC patients as BRCA1-mutated and BRCA1 non-mutated, suggesting that they might be considered as BRCA1-like biomarkers for TNBC and HBOC syndrome.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the most clinically involved with these kinds of cancer and the spectrum of variants affecting these genes is very wide. In fact, point variants, large or small insertions/deletions, genomic rearrangements can be found in these patients, although a large number of variants with uncertain biological and clinical significance continues to be identified. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is actually the most powerful tool for the discovering of causative mutations and novel disease genes, moreover it allows to make a rapid diagnosis of genetic variants giving fast, inexpensive and detailed genetic information.Material and methods: In this study, we report the screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes on 1400 consecutive Caucasian patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer history or family risk, attending the oncogenetic ambulatory at the Foundation Policlinico Agostino Gemelli in Rome.Results: We describe twenty-nine novel BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants detected in Italian individuals suffering from hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC).Conclusion: Data regarding novel variants can provide useful information not only at epidemiological but also at clinical level, allowing for the better managing of breast and ovarian cancer patients and their family members.

We characterized the clinical profile of these individuals and explored the performance of international testing criteria.ResultsA pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant was detected in 19.1% of 418 probands, including seven novel frameshift variants. Variants of uncertain significance were found in 5.7% of individuals. We evaluated 50 testing criteria and mutation probability algorithms. There was a significant odds-ratio (OR) for mutation prediction (p <= 0.05) for 25 criteria; 14 of these had p <= 0.001. Using a cutoff point of four criteria, the sensitivity is 83.8%, and the specificity is 53.5% for being a carrier. The prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants for each criterion ranged from 22.1% to 55.6%, and criteria with the highest ORs were those related to triple-negative breast cancer or ovarian cancer.ConclusionsThis is the largest study of comprehensive BRCA testing among Brazilians to date, and the first to analyze clinical criteria for genetic testing. Several criteria that are not included in the NCCN achieved a higher predictive value. Identification of the most informative criteria for each population will assist in the development of a rational approach to genetic testing, and will enable the prioritization of high-risk individuals as a first step towards offering testing in low-income countries.														1932-6203	1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0187630

Blake									Histopathology (Oxford)		2017	SEP 2017	71	3	339-356	339	356							Extra-uterine high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with ovarian carcinoma, and is one of the leading causes of cancer death in women. Until recently our understanding of HGSC was very limited compared to other common cancers, and it has only been during the last 15 years that we have learned how to diagnose this ovarian carcinoma histotype accurately. Since then, however, there has been rapid progress, with identification of a precursor lesion in the fallopian tube, development of prevention strategies for both those with inherited susceptibility (hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome) and without the syndrome, and elucidation of the molecular events important in oncogenesis. This molecular understanding has led to new treatment strategies for HGSC, with the promise of more to come in the near future. In this review we focus on these recent changes, including diagnostic criteria/differential diagnosis, primary site assignment, precursor lesions and the molecular pathology of HGSC.														0309-0167	1365-2559	10.1111/his.13248

Comm Gynecologic Practice; Soc Gynecologic Oncology								Obstetrics & Gynecology		2017	SEP 2017	130	3	E146-E149	E146	E149							Ovarian cancer is the second most common type of female reproductive cancer, and more women die from ovarian cancer than from cervical cancer and uterine cancer combined. Currently, there is no strategy for early detection of ovarian cancer that reduces ovarian cancer mortality. Taking a detailed personal and family history for breast, gynecologic, and colon cancer facilitates categorizing women based on their risk (average risk or high risk) of developing epithelial ovarian cancer. Women with a strong family history of ovarian, breast, or colon cancer may have hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (BRCA mutation) or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome), and these women are at increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. Women with these conditions should be referred for formal genetic counseling to better assess their cancer risk, including their risk of ovarian cancer. If appropriate, these women may be offered additional testing for early detection of ovarian cancer. The use of transvaginal ultrasonography and tumor markers (such as cancer antigen 125), alone or in combination, for the early detection of ovarian cancer in average- risk women have not been proved to reduce mortality, and harms exist from invasive diagnostic testing (eg, surgery) resulting from false-positive test results. The patient and her obstetrician-gynecologist should maintain an appropriate level of suspicion when potentially relevant signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer are present.														0029-7844	0029-7844

Based on the contemporary understanding of the origins and management of ovarian cancer and for simplicity in this document, ovarian cancer also refers to fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. Clinical genetic testing for gene mutations allows more precise identification of those women who are at an increased risk of inherited breast cancer and ovarian cancer. For these individuals, screening and prevention strategies can be instituted to reduce their risks. Obstetrician-gynecologists play an important role in the identification and management of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. If an obstetrician-gynecologist or other gynecologic care provider does not have the necessary knowledge or expertise in cancer genetics to counsel a patient appropriately, referral to a genetic counselor, gynecologic or medical oncologist, or other genetics specialist should be considered (1). More genes are being discovered that impart varying risks of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and other types of cancer, and new technologies are being developed for genetic testing. This Practice Bulletin focuses on the primary genetic mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, BRCA1 and BRCA2, but also will briefly discuss some of the other genes that have been implicated.														0029-7844	0029-7844

Our purpose is to provide an effective characterization of this LGR using a combination of different methods able to establish the exact breakpoints of the duplication.MAQ assay was used as primary screening method in LGRs detection. Array CGH, RT-PCR, and Long-PCR were used for a careful characterization of rearrangement and breakpoint regions. The Repeat Masker program was employed to identify Alu sequences at breakpoint junctions.RNA analysis showed that this in tandem duplication of exon 3 causes an in frame insertion of 18 amino acids within the protein. Array CGH and Long-PCR strategies revealed that the duplication (g.100411_102863dup) involves exactly 2.452 nucleotides between intron 2 and intron 3 of the gene. In addition, while an Alu Sx sequence was identified at upstream breakpoint, no Alu repeats were found at downstream junction. This supports the hypothesis that the new duplication was the result of a non-homologous recombination event between Alu and Non-Alu sequences.Our strategy, which combines a comprehensive set of methodologies, has been able to characterize the new BRCA1 duplication confirming, as previously reported, that MAQ assay represents a reliable and effective method for a primary screening of BRCA rearrangements. We underline the relevance of incorporating quantitative methods for BRCA genes dosage testing into routine diagnostic practice.				concolino, paola/0000-0002-0523-5744										0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-017-4275-8

We have generated a self-administered questionnaire for patients with gynecologic cancer. This pilot study analyzed the usefulness of this questionnaire and the rates of patients that meet the Society of Gynecologic Oncology criteria in ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer patients.Ovarian or endometrial cancer patients were recruited for this study. After informed consent was obtained, participants completed the questionnaire. Genetic risks were assessed from the data of each patient's questionnaire by Society of Gynecologic Oncology guideline. Clinical and pathological findings were compared between the genetic risk groups.A total of 105 patients were identified with ovarian cancer and 56 patients with endometrial cancer eligible for this study. According to the Society of Gynecologic Oncology guideline, of the 105 ovarian cancer patients, 25 patients (23%) had a 20-25% risk and three patients (2.9%) had a 5-10% risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. A further 22 patients (21%) had a 5-10% risk of Lynch syndrome. Two patients (1.9%) met the Amsterdam criteria II. Of 56 endometrial cancer patients, 24 patients (42.9%) had a 5-10% risk of Lynch syndrome. The endometrial cancer patients with genetic risk of Lynch syndrome were younger (mean age: 47.79) at diagnosis compared to patients without a genetic risk of Lynch syndrome (mean age: 57.91).In this study, we were able to show that the newly designed questionnaire is a useful tool for evaluating cancer family history along with Society of Gynecologic Oncology criteria or Amsterdam criteria II. When considering the risk of Lynch syndrome for a patient with ovarian cancer, it is important to collect a second and third relative's family history.

We had encountered multiple GISTs in the stomach and small intestine during a screening of ovarian cancer for a woman with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome ( HBOC) with breast cancer susceptibility gene II (BRCA2) mutations. The aim of this study was to examine this case in detail. Case Report: A 65-year-old woman diagnosed with HBOC harboring BRCA2 mutations was found to have multiple tumors in the stomach and small intestine by abdominal screening. All tumors were resected, and KIT gene mutations (p. Trp557Leu and p. Lys558Glu) in exon 11 were detected in all tumors and peripheral blood leukocytes. The patient was diagnosed with familial GIST. Conclusion: This was an extremely rare case in which familial GIST with germline KIT gene mutations coexisted with HBOC.														0250-7005	1791-7530	10.21873/anticanres.11466

Rare cases of double heterozygosity for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have been reported quite exceptionally in non-Ashkenazi individuals. We describe the case of a woman who developed a bilateral breast cancer, discovered concomitantly, at 46 years old. Biopsies confirmed the presence of two breast cancers with distinct histology. BRCA analysis was tested due to a positive family history of breast cancer, and two pathogenic monoallelic mutations were detected, one in the BRCA1 gene and one in the BRCA2 gene. There is no known Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. We report the first description of a never described double heterozygosity for BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants in a French metastatic breast cancer patient, with two distinct histology, and two distinct mutations.														1021-335X	1791-2431	10.3892/or.2017.5422

Identifying these individuals by pedigree and BRCA1/2 mutation analyses will enable us to offer targeted mutation testing and appropriate counseling. This study from a tertiary care hospital showed that of the 127 breast cancer patients on treatment during 2014-2015, 24 of them fulfilled the criteria of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome after detailed verbal autopsy and pedigree analysis, and BRCA1 and 2 next-generation sequencing done after pre-test counseling revealed mutations in 13 cases (54%), these included 9 BRCA1 mutations (69%) and 4 BRCA2 mutation (31%). Subsequent post-test counseling recommended targeted mutation analysis for 64 high-risk members in these 13 families with pathogenic mutations, which will help in surveillance for early detection, appropriate management, and prevention of the disease by decreasing the burden to both family and nation. Results from this preliminary study highlight the importance of genetic counseling, pedigree analysis, and genetic testing. It can be recommended that all oncology units should have a genetic counseling service for providing appropriate support to oncologists, patients, and families to prevent unnecessary testing; however, breast cancer screening program is incomplete without evaluating for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.														1010-4283	1423-0380	10.1177/1010428317694303

G.; de Kroon, C. D.; van Wezel, T.; van Asperen, C. J.; Smit, V. T. H. B. M.; Dekkers, O. M.; Bosse, T. (t.bosse@lumc.nl)									European Journal of Cancer		2017	FEB 2017	72		215-225	215	225							Background: Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) shows greater morphological, clinical and molecular similarities to high-grade ovarian tubal serous carcinoma than to other types of endometrial cancer. As high-grade ovarian tubal serous carcinoma is known to be associated with BRCA1/2 pathogenic germline mutations (PMs), we aimed to explore whether USC is also a constituent of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.Methods: Pubmed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched in July 2016 for articles assessing the association between USC and germline BRCA1/2-PMs. Pooled analysis and comparisons were performed using a random effects logistic model, stratifying for ethnicity (Ashkenazi versus non-Ashkenazi). In addition, tumour tissue from an USC case with a hereditary BRCAl-PM was analysed for loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1 locus and was functionally analysed for homologous recombination proficiency.Results: The search yielded 1893 citations, 10 studies were included describing 345 USC patients. For Ashkenazi Jews, the pooled odds ratio of having a germline BRCA1/2-PM was increased in USC patients compared with the general Ashkenazi population: odds ratio 5.4 (95%confidence interval: 2.2-13.1). In the patient with USC, we identified the known germline BRCAl-PM in the tumour DNA. Furthermore, we showed both loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type allele and a deficiency of homologous recombination.Conclusion: This study suggests that USC may be an overlooked component of BRCA1/2-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Screening for germline BRCA1/2-PMs should be considered in patients diagnosed with USC, especially in cases with a positive first-degree family history for breast and/or ovarian cancer.

Methods: A survey was mailed in late 2013 to Florida providers who order HBOC testing. Descriptive statistics were conducted to characterize participants' responses. Results: Of 101 respondents, 66% indicated either no genetics education or education through a commercial laboratory. Although 79% of respondents were aware of the Supreme Court ruling resulting in the loss of Myriad Genetics' BRCA gene patent, only 19% had ordered testing from a different laboratory. With regard to pretest counseling, 78% of respondents indicated they usually discuss 11 of 14 nationally recommended elements for informed consent. Pretest discussion times varied from 3 to 120min, with approximately half spending <20min. Elements not routinely covered by >40% of respondents included (1) possibility of a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) and (2) issues related to life/disability insurance. With regard to genetic testing for HBOC, 88% would test an unaffected sister of a breast cancer patient identified with a BRCA VUS. Conclusions: Results highlight the need to identify whether variability in hereditary cancer service delivery impacts patient outcomes. Findings also reveal opportunities to facilitate ongoing outreach and education.				Scherr, Courtney/0000-0001-9362-5410										1945-0265	1945-0257	10.1089/gtmb.2016.0113

For comparison of distress, we recruited a reference sample of breast cancer survivors (BCS; n = 665) who had not requested GCT in the same setting.Results: Overall, counselees did not exhibit increased levels of anxiety and depression when compared to BCS. No specific follow-up deleterious psychosocial consequences were detected among the former group. Of the 137 counselees, 22.6% and 9.8% experienced clinically relevant levels of anxiety and depression, respectively, at an average follow-up time of 1.8 years. However, both anxiety and depression significantly decreased with time and were alike between counselees with and without cancer diagnosis. Follow-up cancer worry seems to be significantly higher among counselees who had not undergone genetic testing or were undecided about it than among counselees who had been tested.Conclusion: Our results strongly support GCT as part of routine care for patients with HBOC. The risk factors of increased distress in specific subgroups of counselees, such as recent cancer diagnosis or uncertainty about testing, warrant further exploration and specific attention in clinical routines. Particularly, the psychological needs of undecided counselees warrant ongoing attention and potential follow-ups. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

(manuel.teixeira@ipoporto.min-saude.pt)									PLoS One		2016	AUG 17 2016	11	8	Article No.: e0161438	e0161438								BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are responsible for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, but they also confer an increased risk for the development of rarer cancers associated with this syndrome, namely, cancer of the pancreas, male breast, peritoneum, and fallopian tube. The objective of this work was to quantify the contribution of the founder mutations BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu and BRCA1 c.3331_3334del for cancer etiology in unselected hospital-based cohorts of Portuguese patients diagnosed with these rarer cancers, by using a strategy that included testing of archival tumor tissue. A total of 102 male breast, 68 pancreatic and 33 peritoneal/fallopian tube carcinoma cases were included in the study. The BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu mutation was observed with a frequency of 7.8% in male breast cancers, 3.0% in peritoneal/fallopian tube cancers, and 1.6% in pancreatic cancers, with estimated total contributions of germline BRCA2 mutations of 14.3%, 5.5%, and 2.8%, respectively. No carriers of the BRCA1 c.3331_3334del mutation were identified. During our study, a patient with an ampulla of Vater carcinoma was incidentally found to carry the BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu mutation, so we decided to test a consecutive series of additional 15 ampullary carcinomas for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations using a combination of direct founder mutation testing and full gene analysis with next generation sequencing. BRCA2 mutations were observed with a frequency of 14.3% in ampulla of Vater carcinomas. In conclusion, taking into account the implications for both the individuals and their family members, we recommend that patients with these neoplasias should be offered BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing and we here show that it is feasible to test for founder mutations in archival tumor tissue. Furthermore, we identified for the first time a high frequency of germline BRCA2 mutations in ampullary cancers.

Ascertainment bias has been suggested as a reason in previous studies. Likewise, cohort effect, which may be caused by environmental factors, can be misinterpreted as genetic anticipation.METHODSThe authors reviewed the pedigrees of 176 kindreds, segregating those with deleterious mutations in breast cancer genes 1 and 2 (BRCA1/BRCA2) who had at least 2 consecutive generations of the same cancer (breast or ovarian). By using mutation probabilities as analytical weights in weighted random-effect models, generational differences in the age at onset of breast/ovarian cancer were calculated. The analyses were further controlled for ascertainment bias by excluding probands and adjusting for birth-cohort effect in the anticipation models.RESULTSThe mean age at the onset of breast cancer for the probands' generation was 41.9 years, which was 6.8 years and 9.8 years earlier than the parents' and grandparents' generations, respectively. The anticipation effect for breast cancer remained significant after excluding the probands. There was a birth-cohort effect: patients who were born in 1930s and 1940s had breast cancer 5.0 years and 7.6 years earlier than patients who were born before 1920. The difference in breast cancer age of onset across generations was no longer significant after adjusting for birth-cohort effect.CONCLUSIONSThe observed anticipation effect was driven mainly by a decrease in age of onset across birth cohorts, underscoring the need for risk-reducing interventions that target changing environmental/lifestyle factors in BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers. Cancer 2016;122:1913-20. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.After controlling for potential bias, the study found earlier disease onset in successive generation in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome but this observed anticipation effect was mainly driven by a decrease in age of onset across birth cohorts. This finding suggests that environmental/lifestyle factors rather than genetic changes account for the anticipation effect.

In 2001, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, in an effort to contain costs, defined criteria to determine an individual's eligibility for BRCA genetic screening. We studied a cohort of individuals that have undergone genetic testing at Kingston General Hospital between 2001 and late 2013. We focused on determining whether the 13 risk criteria, defined by an expert working group for the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, have performed according to expectations in this cohort. Our findings show that all of the criteria perform well by identifying carriers at the expected 10% rate defined by the guidelines. We demonstrate that loose application of the risk criteria does not further enrich for BRCA variant carriers. Our assessment of the established risk criteria that have been in use in Ontario for more than a decade, provide evidence for their effectiveness, and offer insights into how they may be expanded or improved.

Among these, BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are associated with the Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome, are the most frequently affected genes. Recent studies confirm that gene rearrangements, especially in BRCA1, are responsible for a significant proportion of mutations in certain populations. In this study we determined the prevalence of BRCA rearrangements in 145 unrelated Brazilian individuals at risk for HBOC syndrome who had not been previously tested for BRCA mutations. Using Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) and a specific PCR-based protocol to identify a Portuguese founder BRCA2 mutation, we identified two (1,4%) individuals with germline BRCA1 rearrangements (c.547+240_5193+178del and c.4675+467_5075-990del) and three probands with the c.156_157insAlu founder BRCA2 rearrangement. Furthermore, two families with false positive MLPA results were shown to carry a deleterious point mutation at the probe binding site. This study comprises the largest Brazilian series of HBOC families tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 rearrangements to date and includes patients from three regions of the country. The overall observed rearrangement frequency of 3.44% indicates that rearrangements are relatively uncommon in the admixed population of Brazil.

Since BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may be spread throughout the gene, genetic testing is usually performed by direct sequencing of entire coding regions. In some populations, especially if relatively isolated, a few number of recurrent mutations is reported, sometimes caused by founder effect.Methods: BRCA1 and BRCA2 screening for mutations was carried out on 1114 breast and/or ovarian cancer patients complying with the eligibility criteria for BRCA testing. Haplotype analysis was performed on the probands carrying recurrent mutations and their relatives, using two sets of microsatellite markers covering the BRCA1 (D17S588, D17S806, D17S902, D17S1325, D17S855, D17S1328, D17S800, and D17S250) and BRCA2 (D13S220, D13S267, D13S171, D13S1701, D13S1698, D13S260, D13S290, D13S1246) loci. The DMLE + 2.2 software was used to estimate the age of BRCA1 c.676delT and BRCA2 c.7806-2A > G. A multiplex PCR and two different primer extension assays were optimized and used for genotyping the recurrent mutations of the two genes.Results: In the time frame of almost 20 years of genetic testing, we have found that five BRCA1 and three BRCA2 mutations are recurrent in a substantial subset of carriers from North-East Italy and neighboring Istria, where they represent more than 50 % of all mutations. Microsatellite analyses identified a common haplotype of different length for each mutation. Age estimation of BRCA1 c.676delT and BRCA2 c.7806-2A > G mutations revealed that they arose in the Friuli Venezia Giulia area about 86 and 94 generations ago, respectively. Suggestion of an association between BRCA2 c.7806-2A > G and risk of breast cancer in males has emerged. Finally, we developed a simple and efficient pre-screeening test, performing an in-house primer extension SNaPshot (R) assay for the rapid identification of the eight recurrent mutations.Conclusions: Proofs of common ancestry has been obtained for the eight recurrent mutations. The observed genotype-phenotype correlation and the proposed rapid mutation detection strategy could improve the clinical management of breast and ovarian patients in North-East of Italy and neighboring geographic areas.

New England Journal of Medicine		2016	FEB 4 2016	374	5	454-468	454	468							HEREDITARY BREAST AND OVARIAN CANCER IS A SYNDROME THAT INvolves an increased predisposition to breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or both and an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission. The numbers of breast-cancer diagnoses, the ages of patients at diagnosis, and the occurrence of ovarian cancer in addition to breast cancer vary among families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. The likelihood of detecting an underlying disease-causing mutation is highest in the most severely affected families, especially those with ovarian cancer. Disease-causing mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, the genes most often associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, are identified in only a minority of families with suspected hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.Risk-reducing mastectomy and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy are options for the primary prevention of breast and ovarian cancers, and they have been shown in multiple studies to have efficacy. However, these procedures, which have profound effects on a woman's body, are associated with complex and emotionally charged decision making.In this review, we address issues related to the care of women in families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome who have not had cancer. We discuss risk assessment for breast and ovarian cancers according to the woman's age, the efficacy of risk-reducing surgery, the complications and psychosocial effects of these procedures, alternative strategies for risk management, and the best ways to facilitate individual decision making.														0028-4793	1533-4406	10.1056/NEJMra1503523

Genetic testing of these genes identifies a significant proportion of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Elucidation of the clinical impact of these variants is an important challenge in genetic diagnostics and counseling. In this study, we assess the RNA effect of 28 BRCA1 and BRCA2 VUS identified in our set of HBOCS families with the aim of gaining insight into their clinical relevance. mRNA was extracted from VUS carriers and controls lymphocytes cultured for 5-6 days and treated with puromycin. RNA was reverse transcribed to perform transcriptional analysis for the study of splicing aberrations. In silico prediction tools were used to select those variants most likely to affect the RNA splicing process. Six out of the 28 variants analyzed showed an aberrant splicing pattern and could therefore be classified as probably pathogenic mutations. Reclassification of VUS improves the genetic counseling and clinical surveillance of carriers of these mutations and highlights the importance of RNA studies in routine diagnostic laboratories.

Preventive salpingo-oophorectomy is currently the only method known to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer-related death. Histopathological analyses of these surgical specimens indicate that a high proportion of ovarian cancers in women at high risk and in the general population arise from the fallopian tube. This paradigm shift concerning the cell of origin for the most common subtype of ovarian cancer, highgrade serous carcinoma, has sparked a major effort within the research community to develop new and robust model systems to study the fallopian tube epithelium as the cell of origin of "ovarian" cancer. In this review, evidence supporting the fallopian tube as the origin of ovarian cancer is presented as are novel experimental model systems for studying the fallopian tube epithelium in high-risk women as well as in the general population. This review also addresses the clinical implications of the newly proposed cell of origin, the clinical questions that arise, and novel strategies for ovarian cancer prevention. (C)2015 AACR.

The BARD1 protein is the heterodimeric partner of BRCA1 and is included on clinical gene panels for testing for susceptibility to HBOC. Like BRCA1, it is required for homology-directed DNA repair (HDR). We measured the HDR function of 29 BARD1 missense variants, 27 culled from clinical test results and two synthetic variants. Twenty-three of the assayed variants were functional for HDR; of these, four are known neutral variants. Three variants showed intermediate function, and three others were defective in HDR. When mapped to BARD1 domains, residues crucial for HDR were located in the N- and C- termini of BARD1. In the BARD1 RING domain, critical residues mapped to the zinc-coordinating amino acids and to the BRCA1-BARD1 binding interface, highlighting the importance of interaction between BRCA1 and BARD1 for HDR activity. Based on these results, we propose that the HDR assay is a useful complement to genetic analyses to classify BARD1 variants of unknown clinical significance. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift		2015	AUG 2015	127	15-16	652-654	652	654							In Austria, 700 women are diagnosed every year with ovarian carcinoma. Approximately 15 % of the patients with epithelial ovarian cancer have a germline mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. The increased incidence of breast and/or ovarian cancer in genetically related family members has given rise to the term "hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome" (HBOC). Some 25-55 % of these in-family diseases are attributed to germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, and approximately 5-10 % to other known tumor predisposition syndromes. The remaining persons may carry mutations in as yet unidentified genes. HBOC caused by BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is an autosomal dominant disorder with high penetrance. BRCA1 and BRCA2 encode for so-called tumor suppressor proteins. Inherited functional mutations of these genes cause loss of function of the respective allele. Loss of function of the second allele causes complete loss of the corresponding protein and facilitates the development of a malignancy.The Association of Gynecologic Oncology recommends that testing for a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 should be offered to all patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. When mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, or other cancer-susceptibility genes have been identified, patients with ovarian carcinoma can be treated with new, innovative therapies. This recommendation is intended as a standard guideline for genetic testing of patients with an ovarian carcinoma.														0043-5325	1613-7671	10.1007/s00508-015-0814-7

This study compares the diagnostic workflow in two centers and gives valuable insights into different next-generation sequencing (NGS) strategies. Moreover, we present data from 620 patients sequenced at both centers. Both sequencing centers are part of the German consortium for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (GC-HBOC). All 620 patients included in this study were selected following standard BRCA1/2 testing guidelines. A set of 10 sequenced genes was analyzed per patient. Twelve samples were exchanged and sequenced at both centers. NGS results were highly concordant in 12 exchanged samples (205/206 variants = 99.51 %). One non-pathogenic variant was missed at center B due to a sequencing gap (no technical coverage). The custom enrichment at center B was optimized during this study; for example, the average number of missing bases was reduced by a factor of four (vers. 1: 1939.41, vers. 4: 506.01 bp). There were no sequencing gaps at center A, but four CCDS exons were not included in the enrichment. Pathogenic mutations were found in 12.10 % (75/620) of all patients: 4.84 % (30/620) in BRCA1, 4.35 % in BRCA2 (27/620), 0.97 % in CHEK2 (6/620), 0.65 % in ATM (4/620), 0.48 % in CDH1 (3/620), 0.32 % in PALB2 (2/620), 0.32 % in NBN (2/620), and 0.16 % in TP53 (1/620). NGS diagnostics for HBOC-related genes is robust, cost effective, and the method of choice for genetic testing in large cohorts. Adding 8 genes to standard BRCA1- and BRCA2-testing increased the mutation detection rate by one-third.

Proof of de novo mutations in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) families is rare, in contrast to founder mutations, thousands of years old, that may be carried by as much as 1% of a population. Thus, if mutations favoring cancer survive selection pressure through time, they must provide advantages that compensate for the loss of life expectancy.MethodThis hypothesis was tested within 2,150 HBOC families encompassing 96,325 individuals. Parameters included counts of breast/ovarian cancer, age at diagnosis, male breast cancer and other cancer locations. As expected, well-known clinical parameters discriminated between BRCA-mutated families and others: young age at breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and male breast cancer. The major fertility differences concerned men in BRCA-mutated families: they had lower first and mean age at paternity, and fewer remained childless. For women in BRCA families, the miscarriage rate was lower. In a logistic regression including clinical factors, the different miscarriage rate and men's mean age at paternity remained significant.ResultsFertility advantages were confirmed in a subgroup of 746 BRCA mutation carriers and 483 non-carriers from BRCA mutated families. In particular, female carriers were less often nulliparous (9.1 % of carriers versus 16.0 %, p = 0.003) and had more children (1.8 +/- 1.4 SD versus 1.5 +/- 1.3, p = 0.002) as well as male carriers (1.7 +/- 1.3 versus 1.4 +/- 1.3, p = 0.024).ConclusionAlthough BRCA mutations shorten the reproductive period due to cancer mortality, they compensate by improving fertility both in male and female carriers.

Cases of cancer commonly encountered by obstetrician-gynecologists or other obstetric-gynecologic providers-such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer-are features of specific hereditary cancer syndromes. The most common hereditary cancer syndromes related to gynecologic cancer include hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. A hereditary cancer risk assessment is the key to identifying patients and families who may be at increased risk of developing certain types of cancer. Screening should include, at minimum, a personal cancer history and a first-and second-degree relative cancer history that includes a description of the type of primary cancer, the age of onset, and the lineage (paternal versus maternal) of the family member. In addition, a patient's ethnic background can influence her genetic risk. If a hereditary cancer risk assessment suggests an increased risk of a hereditary cancer syndrome, referral to a specialist in cancer genetics or a health care provider with expertise in genetics is recommended for expanded gathering of family history information, risk assessment, education, and counseling, which may lead to genetic testing.														0029-7844	0029-7844

Standard genetic screening includes targeted analysis of recurrent, population-specific mutations. The purpose of the study was to establish the frequency of germline BRCA1/2 mutations in a group of 134 unrelated patients with primary ovarian cancer. Next generation sequencing analysis revealed a presence of 20 (14.9 %) mutations, where 65 % (n = 13) were recurrent BRCA1 alterations included in the standard diagnostic panel in northern Poland. However, the remaining seven BRCA1/2 mutations (35 %) would be missed by the standard approach and were detected in unique patients. A substantial proportion (n = 5/12; 41 %) of mutation-positive individuals with complete family history reported no incidence of breast or ovarian cancer in their relatives. This observation, together with the raising perspectives for personalized therapy targeting BRCA1/2 signaling pathways indicates the necessity of comprehensive genetic screening in all ovarian cancer patients. However, due to the limited sensitivity of the standard genetic screening presented in this study (65 %) an application of next generation sequencing in molecular diagnostics of BRCA1/2 genes should be considered.

(patricia.tonin@mcgill.ca)									BMC Medical Genetics		2015	APR 12 2015	16		Article No.: 24	24								Background: Specific germline mutations in the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility (HBC/HBOC) genes, BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2, have been shown to recur in French Canadians of Quebec, Canada, and this has been attributed to common ancestors. Germline TP53 mutation carriers are known to segregate in Li-Fraumeni syndrome families, which feature young age of onset breast cancer. We have reported rare TP53 mutation carriers in French Canadian HBC families, though none recurred possibly due to the limited number of cancer families investigated. Here we describe TP53 germline mutations found in French Canadian cancer families provided from hereditary cancer clinics; investigate 37 new BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative HBC/HBOC families for the TP53 mutations; and assess the frequency of TP53 mutations in a 1235 French Canadian breast cancer cases not selected for family history of cancer.Methods: TP53 mutation-positive pedigrees from French Canadian cancer families were provided from local hereditary cancer clinics. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing of all protein encoding exons of TP53 was performed using peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA from breast/ovarian cancer probands from 37 HBC/HBOC families of French Canadian descent. Targeted bidirectional Sanger sequencing assay of regions containing the identified TP53 mutations was performed on 1235 French Canadian breast cancer cases not selected for family history cancer.Results: Five new TP53 mutations were identified in six pedigrees from hereditary cancer clinics. No deleterious mutations were identified in cancer probands from 37 HBC/HBOC families. A targeted mutation screen of the 1235 breast cancer cases identified a c.844C>T [p.Arg282Trp] mutation carrier. This mutation was also found among the six mutation-positive cancer families provided by the local hereditary cancer clinics. The targeted screen also uncovered a new TP53 mutation, c.685T>C [p.Cys229Arg] that was found in two breast cancer cases. All TP53 mutation carriers were among the 656 women with breast cancer diagnosed less than 50 years of age.Conclusions: In all six new TP53 mutations were identified in French Canadians, where two each occurred in independently ascertained cases/families. Although all newly identified breast cancer mutation carriers reported a family history of cancer, none were consistent with features of Li-Fraumeni syndrome families.

Among Ashkenazi Jews, there are three founder mutations that occur frequently in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. This mutation panel is often the initial genetic test in persons of Ashkenazi descent being evaluated for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndrome. To explore this in polyposis, we compared the frequency of APC and MUTYH alterations between Ashkenazi Jews (AJ) and non-Ashkenazi Jews (NAJ) with colorectal adenomas. Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted in 5236 subjects with colorectal adenomas who underwent full gene sequencing and large rearrangement analysis of the APC gene and DNA sequence analysis for the two common Caucasian MUTYH mutations (p.Y165C, p.G382D). Individuals with either mutation had subsequent MUTYH full sequencing. We compared the prevalence of pathogenic APC and MUTYH mutations by adenoma count in AJ and NAJ and evaluated the phenotype of APC*I1307K carriers using multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for age, gender, adenoma count and family history of colorectal cancer (CRC). Results: Pathogenic APC mutations were found in 22/208 AJ (10.6%) and 983/5028 NAJ (19.6%; p=0.0008) and biallelic MUTYH mutations in 1 (0.5%) AJ and 286 (5.7%) NAJ (p=0.0001). The prevalence of pathogenic APC or MUTYH mutations was 10/23 (43.5%) and 745/1139 (65.4%) in subjects with >= 100 adenomas (p=0.04), 10/98 (10.2%) and 414/2379 (17.4%) with 20-99 adenomas (p=0.07), 3/40 (7.5%) and 58/686 (8.5%) with 10 - 19 adenomas (p=1) and 0/47 (0%) and 52/824 (6.3%) with 1-9 adenomas (p=0.11), in AJ and NAJ respectively. In AJ, the R332X alteration in the APC gene was the most common pathogenic mutation and was present in 6/22 (27.2%) AJ compared to 17/983 (1.7%) NAJ (p=0.0001). The I1307K variant occurred in 32 (15.4%) AJ and 22 (0.5%) NAJ (p=0.0001); among AJ this variant was significantly associated with a diagnosis of CRC (OR: 2.6 [95% CI: 1.1-5.8]). Conclusion: Overall, the frequency of pathogenic APC or MUTYH mutations increases with adenoma count and is lower in AJ compared to NAJ. The low yield of comprehensive MUTYH testing in AJ suggests this gene plays a small role in AJ with polyposis and that other genes may be responsible for the polyposis phenotype in Ashkenazim. The higher prevalence of the APC*R332X mutation in AJ compared to NAJ suggests R332X may be a founder mutation. This should be further explored through haplotype analysis. Finally, we propose that increased colorectal screening be considered in Ashkenazim who have the I1307K variant and report a personal history of colorectal adenomas.														0016-5085	1528-0012

Glenn									American Journal of Surgical Pathology		2015	MAR 2015	39	3	357-364	357	364							Most nonuterine high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs) in women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, due to germline BRCA1/2 mutation, arise in the fimbria of the fallopian tube. However, the site of origin of sporadic HGSC, which is usually widely disseminated at presentation, is not well established. We sought to characterize cases of HGSC discovered incidentally in patients not known to be at high risk, in order to determine the site distribution and possible origin of sporadic HGSC. Incidental microscopic, non-mass-forming cases of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma or HGSC in salpingo-oophorectomy specimens in which the tubes and ovaries had been extensively examined were identified. No patients were known or suspected BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Twenty-one cases were identified (mean age: 57 y). Surgery was for benign disease (n = 15), uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma or atypical hyperplasia (n = 3), bladder carcinoma (n = 1), or ovarian serous borderline tumor (n = 2). In 16 of 21 cases, the lesion was confined to the fallopian tube (unilateral in 14 cases, bilateral in 2). There was serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma in all cases and invasive HGSC into the underlying lamina propria in 8 of these 16 cases; the invasive focus measured 1.3 cm or less in every case. In the remaining 5 cases, there was fallopian tube mucosal and ovarian involvement; in 2 of these cases, there was also microscopic peritoneal involvement. Sporadic cases of nonuterine HGSC arise in the fallopian tube fimbria in a large majority of cases, providing further evidence for the tubal origin of these neoplasms.

Early identification of these patients after an initial cancer diagnosis is the key to implementing cancer risk-reducing strategies.Methods: A commercial laboratory database was searched for women with a history of both breast and ovarian or colorectal and endometrial cancer who underwent genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) or Lynch syndrome (LS).Results: Among women with both breast and ovarian cancer, 22.4% (2,237/9,982) had a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Among women with both colorectal and ovarian cancer, 28.1% (264/941) had a mutation associated with LS. In 66.6% of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers and in 58.3% of LS mutation carriers, >5 years passed between the cancer diagnoses. Of patients with HBOC and LS, 56 and 65.2%, respectively, met the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for hereditary cancer testing after their initial diagnosis based on their personal cancer history alone.Conclusions: A substantial number of women tested for LS or HBOC after being diagnosed with two successive primary cancers were diagnosed with a hereditary cancer syndrome. In many cases, the time interval between the diagnoses was long enough to allow for the implementation of surveillance and/or prophylactic measures.(C) 2014 S.

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2015	JAN 2015	149	1	223-227	223	227							An estimated 1:40 individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) ancestry carry one of three common founder mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, resulting in the inherited cancer condition, Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome. Targeted testing for these three mutations (BRCA1 187delAG, BRCA1 5385insC, and BRCA2 6174delT) is therefore recommended for all AJ breast and ovarian cancer patients, regardless of age of diagnosis or family history. Comprehensive analysis of both genes is recommended for a subset of AJ patients in whom founder mutations are not identified, but estimates of the yield from comprehensive analysis in this population vary widely. We sought to determine the proportion of non-founder mutations as a percentage of all mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 among AJ patients to inform decisions about HBOC testing strategies in this population. We analyzed the genetic testing results for 37,952 AJ patients for whom clinical testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was performed at Myriad Genetic Laboratories from January 2006 through August 2013. Analysis was limited to AJ-only patients for whom the initial test order was either (1) comprehensive testing, or (2) founder mutation testing with instructions to automatically "reflex" to comprehensive analysis if negative. Cases were excluded if a separate follow-up order was placed to reflex to comprehensive analysis only after the founder mutation testing was reported out as negative. Among all BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations detected in these groups, the percentage of non-founder mutations was 13 % (104/802) and 7.2 % (198/2,769). One-hundred and eighty-nine unique non-founder mutations were detected, 76 in BRCA1 and 113 in BRCA2. Non-founder mutations make up between 7.2 and 13.0 % of all BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi Jews. A wide range of mutations are present, most of which are also seen in non-AJ individuals.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-014-3218-x

(joseph.rabban@ucsf.edu) ; Garg, Karuna; Crawford, Beth; Chen, Lee-may; Zaloudek, Charles J.									American Journal of Surgical Pathology		2014	JUN 2014	38	6	729-742	729	742							Early detection of sporadic pelvic serous carcinoma remains an elusive goal. In women at high risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome who undergo prophylactic salpingectomy, systematic pathologic examination of the fallopian tubes will detect occult tubal cancer, mostly in the fimbriae, of a minority of women. Such tubal cancers are the putative precursor to advanced-stage pelvic cancer. We hypothesized that early tubal cancer detection can also be accomplished in women at low risk using a similar approach. In this study, we performed complete and systematic examination of the fallopian tubes removed during surgery performed for benign indications. Among 522 women, 4 cases of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) were identified. Three of these cases would have gone undetected using the current standard of care of sampling only a single random section of the tube. The fourth case was accompanied by occult ovarian carcinoma. The fimbriae contained STIC in 3 of the 4 cases and atypical mucosa in 1 case in which the STIC was in the nonfimbriated portion of the tube. The morphologic and immunohistochemical features (aberrant p53 and MIB-1) of these STICs were similar to those expected in high-risk women. All 4 patients with STIC underwent BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene testing; no germline mutations were identified in any patient. An additional 11 specimens contained atypical mucosal proliferations that fell short of morphologic and immunohistochemical criteria for STIC. Two of these 11 fulfilled criteria for a serous tubal intraepithelial lesion, and the remaining atypical proliferations exhibited normal p53 and MIB-1. For most specimens, the fimbriae could be completely submitted in 1 or 2 cassettes per tube. These results demonstrate that systematic examination of the tubal fimbriae can serve as a form of early detection of sporadic tubal cancer without incurring significant labor or cost. We propose that the tubal fimbriae should be completely examined in all patients undergoing benign surgery even if there are no clinical features to suggest risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.														0147-5185	1532-0979	10.1097/PAS.0000000000000199

Here, we report the first case of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma identified through a risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in a Japanese woman with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and who had a deleterious germline mutation of E1214X in BRCA1, but not a BRCA2 mutation. A pre-operative examination revealed multiple uterine leiomyomas but no adnexal mass. Robotic-assisted bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy together with hysterectomy was performed. A pathological examination identified serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma in the right fallopian tube with no dissemination. Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma is implicated as an origin of invasive cancer of the fallopian tube with peritoneal dissemination; prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy is currently the only method to identify this occult cancer. Our case demonstrated that risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy can detect occult cancers, including serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, thereby preventing future cancer development in the Japanese hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome population.

Human Reproduction (Oxford)		2014	MAY 2014	29	5	1103-1112	1103	1112							How do couples with a BRCA1/2 mutation decide on preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and prenatal diagnosis (PND) for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC)?BRCA couples primarily classify PGD and/or PND as reproductive options based on the perceived severity of HBOC and moral considerations, and consequently weigh the few important advantages of PGD against numerous smaller disadvantages.Awareness of PGD is generally low among persons at high risk for hereditary cancers. Most persons with HBOC are in favour of offering PGD for BRCA1/2 mutations, although only a minority would consider this option for themselves. Studies exploring the motivations for using or refraining from PGD among well-informed BRCA carriers of reproductive age are lacking. We studied the reproductive decision-making process by interviewing a group of well-informed, reproductive aged couples carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation, regarding their decisional motives and considerations.This exploratory, qualitative study investigated the motives and considerations taken into account by couples with a BRCA1/2 mutation and who have received extensive counselling on PGD and PND and have made a well-informed decision regarding this option. Eighteen couples took part in focus group and dyadic interviews between January and September 2012.Semi-structured focus groups were conducted containing two to four couples, assembled based on the reproductive method the couple had chosen: PGD (n 6 couples) or conception without testing (n 8 couples). Couples who had chosen PND for BRCA (n 4) were interviewed dyadically. Two of the women, of whom one had chosen PND and the other had chosen no testing, had a history of breast cancer.None of the couples who opted for PGD or conception without testing found the use of PND, with possible pregnancy termination, acceptable. PND users chose this method because of decisive, mainly practical reasons (natural conception, high chance of favourable outcome). Motives and considerations regarding PGD largely overlapped between PGD users, PND users and non-users, all mentioning some significant advantages (e.g. protecting the child and family from the mutation) and many smaller disadvantages (e.g. the necessity of in vitro fertilization (IVF), low chance of pregnancy by IVF/PGD). For female carriers, the safety of hormonal stimulation and the time required for PGD before undergoing preventive surgeries were important factors in the decision. Non-users expressed doubts about the moral justness of their decision afterwards and emphasized the impact the decision still had on their lives.The interviewed couples were at different stages in their chosen trajectory, up to 3 years after completion. This may have led to recall bias of original motives and considerations. Couples who did not actively seek information about PGD were excluded. Therefore the results may not be readily generalizable to all BRCA couples.The perceived severity of HBOC and, for female carriers, the safety of hormonal stimulation and the time frames for PGD planning before preventive surgeries are essential items BRCA couples consider in reproductive decision-making. The emotional impact of this decision should not be underestimated; especially non-users may experience feelings of doubt or guilt up to several years afterwards. PGD counselling with tailored information addressing these items and decisional support in order to guarantee well-informed decision-making is needed.This study was funded by the Dutch breast cancer foundation Stichting Pink Ribbon, grant number 2010.PS11.C74.

The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 (FANCD1) is one of the 16 genes involved in this recessive disease. We have identified a novel mutation of the splice donor site of intron 1 in the noncoding region of BRCA2 in a Japanese FA family. This mutation may account for the FA phenotype in a patient originally reported to have biallelic mutations in BRCA2. Subsequent functional studies revealed that one of the mutations, K2729N, was a neutral change. As reported here, a more careful analysis resulted in the identification of a novel splice site mutation. Functional analysis using a mouse embryonic stem cell-based assay revealed that it causes aberrant splicing, reduced transcript levels and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents, suggesting that it is likely to be pathogenic. Although similar pathogenic variants in the noncoding region of BRCA1 and 2 were not identified in a cohort of 752 familial breast cancer cases, we still think this finding is relevant for mutation analysis in Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome families in a diagnostic setting.														1059-7794	1098-1004	10.1002/humu.22505

We looked at the experiences of young people who had had predictive testing for a range of conditions with variable ages at onset and options for screening and treatment. A consecutive series of 61 young people who had a predictive test aged 15-25 years at the Clinical Genetic Service, Manchester, for HD, HBOC (BrCa 1 or 2) or FCM (Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy or Dilated Cardiomyopathy), were invited to participate. Thirty-six (36/61; 59%) agreed to participate (10 HD, 16 HBOC and 10 FCM) and telephone interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. None of the participants expressed regret at having the test at a young age. Participants saw the value of pretest counselling not in facilitating a decision, but rather as a source of information and support. Differences emerged among the three groups in parent/family involvement in the decision to be tested. Parents in FCM families were a strong influence in favour of testing, in HBOC the decision was autonomous but usually congruent with the views of parents, whereas in HD the decision was autonomous and sometimes went against the opinions of parents/grandparents. Participants from all three groups proposed more tailoring of predictive test counselling to the needs of young people.														1018-4813	1476-5438	10.1038/ejhg.2013.143

Here, we report the characterization of the BRCA1 c. 190T>C (p. Cys64Arg) mutation, mapped to the RING-finger domain coding region, that we detected in 43 hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) families, for the large part originating from the province of Bergamo (Northern Italy). Haplotype analysis was performed in 21 families, and led to the identification of a shared haplotype extending over three BRCA1-associated marker loci (0.4 cM). Using the DMLE+2.2 software program and regional population demographic data, we were able to estimate the age of the mutation to vary between 3,100 and 3,350 years old. Functional characterization of the mutation was carried out at both transcript and protein level. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis on lymphoblastoid cells revealed expression of full length mRNA from the mutant allele. A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fragment reassembly assay showed that the p. Cys64Arg substitution prevents the binding of the BRCA1 protein to the interacting protein BARD1, in a similar way as proven deleterious mutations in the RING-domain. Overall, 55 of 83 (66%) female mutation carriers had a diagnosis of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Our observations indicate that the BRCA1 c. 190T>C is a pathogenic founder mutation present in the Italian population. Further analyses will evaluate whether screening for this mutation can be suggested as an effective strategy for the rapid identification of at-risk individuals in the Bergamo area.

(miguelm@inca.gov.br)									Molecular Biology Reports		2014	JAN 2014	41	1	489-495	489	495							We analyzed wild-type (WT) and four sequence variants of the BRCA1 promoter region-found in patients selected for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome-in respect to their influence on transcription and translation efficiencies in transient transfection assays in the presence or absence of estrogen. Five types of plasmids containing the EGFP reporter gene proceeded by WT 5'UTR-a, WT 5'UTR-b, and the three 5'UTR-b variants were constructed to evaluate their influence on translation. Plasmids containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene were constructed with the WT BRCA1 promoter region (containing promoter alpha, 5'UTR-a, promoter beta, and 5'UTR-b) and with the four promoter variants for evaluating their influence on transcription and translation. All constructs were transfected in MCF7 cells maintained with and without estrogen. Expression of EGFP plasmids with WT 5'UTR-a was six to sevenfold higher than of plasmids with WT 5'UTR-b, expression of WT and the three variant 5'UTR-b plasmids showed slight differences in EGFP expression, and the presence or absence of estrogen result in non-significant changes in expression. Promoter's constructs that carry the variants WT or g.3988C showed a higher firefly luciferase activity when estrogen is present; conversely, no significant differences were found in the transcription efficiency of the reporter gene indicating that estrogen affect the translation rather than transcription. The presence or absence of estrogen did not affect the activity of firefly luciferase for constructs with the other promoter variants, being the transcription efficiencies equivalent in both conditions.

L.; Jonkers, Jos (j.jonkers@nki.nl)									Cancer Discovery		2013	OCT 2013	3	10	1142-1155	1142	1155							Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for the majority of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, and therefore sequence analysis of both genes is routinely conducted in patients with early-onset breast cancer. Besides mutations that clearly abolish protein function or are known to increase cancer risk, a large number of sequence variants of uncertain significance (VUS) have been identified. Although several functional assays for BRCA1 VUSs have been described, thus far it has not been possible to conduct a high-throughput analysis in the context of the full-length protein. We have developed a relatively fast and easy cDNA-based functional assay to classify BRCA1 VUSs based on their ability to functionally complement BRCA1-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells. Using this assay, we have analyzed 74 unclassified BRCA1 missense mutants for which all predicted pathogenic variants are confined to the BRCA1 RING and BRCT domains.SIGNIFICANCE: BRCA1 VUSs are frequently found in patients with hereditary breast or ovarian cancer and present a serious problem for clinical geneticists. This article describes the generation, validation, and application of a reliable high-throughput assay for the functional classification of BRCA1 sequence variants of uncertain significance.

This review integrates recent progress and insights into the molecular basis that underlie the HBOC syndrome. A review of English language literature was performed by searching MEDLINE published between January 1994 and October 2012. Mutations and common sequence variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) genes are responsible for the majority of HBOC syndrome. Lifetime cancer risks in BRCA mutation carriers are 60-80% for breast cancer and 20-40% for ovarian cancer. Mutations in BRCA genes cannot account for all cases of HBOC, indicating that the remaining cases can be attributed to the involvement of constitutive epimutations or other cancer susceptibility genes, which include Fanconi anemia (FA) cluster (FANCD2, FANCA and FANCC), mismatch repair (MMR) cluster (MLH1, MSH2, PMS1, PMS2 and MSH6), DNA repair cluster (ATM, ATR and CHK1/2), and tumor suppressor cluster (TP53, SKT11 and PTEN). Sporadic breast cancers with TP53 mutations or epigenetic silencing (hypermethylation), ER-and PgR-negative status, an earlier age of onset and high tumor grade resemble phenotypically BRCA1 mutated cancers termed 'BRCAness', those with no BRCA mutations but with a dysfunction of the DNA repair system. In conclusion, genetic or epigenetic loss-of-function mutations of genes that are known to be involved in the repair of DNA damage may lead to increased risk of developing a broad spectrum of breast and ovarian cancers.														1021-335X	1791-2431	10.3892/or.2013.2541

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2013	AUG 2013	141	1	135-144	135	144							Based on nationwide data from the French national cancer institute (INCa), we analyzed the evolution of cancer genetics consultations and testing over time, and the uptake of targeted tests in relatives of families with BRCA1/2 or MMR genes mutation. Genetic testing and consultations for familial high-risk individuals are exclusively funded and monitored by the INCa in France. All nationwide cancer genetics centers reported annually standardized parameters of activity from 2003 to 2011. The analysis included a total of 240,134 consultations and 134,652 genetic tests enabling to identify 32,494 mutation carriers. Referral for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) or colorectal cancer predisposition syndromes represented 59 % (141,639) and 23.2 % (55,698) consultations, respectively. From 2003 to 2011, we found a dramatic and steady increase of tests performed for BRCA1/2 (from 2,095 to 7,393 tests/year, P < 0.0001) but not for MMR genes (from 1,144 to 1,635/year, P = NS). The overall percentage of deleterious mutations identified in the probands tested was 13.8 and 20.9 % in HBOC and Lynch syndromes, respectively. Pooled analysis for BRCA1/2 and Lynch syndrome tests showed an inverse relationship between the percentage of mutation detected and the absolute number of tests performed over the time (overall Cochran-Armitage test for trend: P < 0.001). In families with BRCA1/2 or MMR identified mutations, there was an average number of 2.94 and 3.28 relatives performing targeted tests, respectively. This nationwide study shows a lack of referral and genetic testing in Lynch as compared to HBOC syndromes. Only a third of relatives of a proband with a predisposing mutation performed a targeted test. Enhanced information about benefit of genetic testing should be given to clinicians and patients for Lynch syndrome and relatives of a proband carrying an identified predisposing mutation.

The aim of this study was to develop an NGS-based workflow for routine diagnostics for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOCS), to improve genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2. A NGS-based workflow was designed using BRCA MASTR kit amplicon libraries followed by GS Junior pyrosequencing. Data analysis combined Variant Identification Pipeline freely available software and ad hoc R scripts, including a cascade of filters to generate coverage and variant calling reports. A BRCA homopolymer assay was performed in parallel. A research scheme was designed in two parts. A Training Set of 28 DNA samples containing 23 unique pathogenic mutations and 213 other variants (33 unique) was used. The workflow was validated in a set of 14 samples from HBOCS families in parallel with the current diagnostic workflow (Validation Set). The NGS-based workflow developed permitted the identification of all pathogenic mutations and genetic variants, including those located in or close to homopolymers. The use of NGS for detecting copy-number alterations was also investigated. The workflow meets the sensitivity and specificity requirements for the genetic diagnosis of HBOCS and improves on the cost-effectiveness of current approaches.

Mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, encoding two proteins involved in DNA repair, underlie most cases of such hereditary cancers. Women with BRCA mutations develop breast cancer in 50-80 % of cases and ovarian cancer in 10-40 % of cases. Assessing BRCA mutational status is needed to direct the clinical management of women with predisposition to these hereditary cancers. However, BRCA screening constitutes a bottleneck in terms of costs and time to deliver results. We developed a PCR-based assay using 73 primer pairs covering the entire coding regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2. PCR primers, containing at the 5' end the universal M13 primer sequences, were pre-spotted in 96-well plates. Following PCR, direct sequencing was performed using M13 primers, allowing to standardize the conditions. PCR amplification and sequencing were successful for each amplicon. We tested and validated the assay on 10 known gDNAs from patients with Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Our strategy is a promising time and cost-effective method to detect BRCA mutations in the clinical setting, which is essential to formulate a personalized therapy for patients with HBOC.

However, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy has rarely been performed in Japan.We developed the first system in Japan for performing risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers at our university hospital in 2008.The indication for risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy for patients with hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome is currently limited in Japan. This situation may be because of the limited number of genetic counseling units, the limited number of facilities that can perform BRCA1/2 genetic testing and the fact that prophylactic surgery is not covered by health insurance in Japan.Recent treatment guidelines for breast cancer in Japan recommended risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy should be performed in the framework of the standard therapeutic modality for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in the near future.

Genetic testing of these genes is available, although approximately 15% of tests identify variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Classification of these variants into pathogenic or non-pathogenic type is an important challenge in genetic diagnosis and counseling. The aim of the present study is to functionally assess a set of 7 missense VUS (Q1409L, S1473P, E1586G, R1589H, Y1703S, W1718L and G1770V) located in the C-terminal region of BRCA1 by combining in silico prediction tools and structural analysis with a transcription activation (TA) assay. The in silico prediction programs gave discrepant results making its interpretation difficult. Structural analysis of the three variants located in the BRCT domains (Y1703S, W1718L and G1770V) reveals significant alterations of BRCT structure. The TA assay shows that variants Y1703S, W1718L and G1770V dramatically compromise the transcriptional activity of BRCA1, while variants Q1409L, S1473P, E1586G and R1589H behave like wild-type BRCA1. In conclusion, our results suggest that variants Y1703S, W1718L and G1770V can be classified as likely pathogenic BRCA1 mutations.

(Rita.Schmutzler@uk-koeln.de)									PLoS One		2012	DEC 11 2012	7	12	Article No.: e50800	e50800								Screening for pathogenic mutations in breast and ovarian cancer genes such as BRCA1/2, CHEK2 and RAD51C is common practice for individuals from high-risk families. However, test results may be ambiguous due to the presence of unclassified variants (UCV) in the concurrent absence of clearly cancer-predisposing mutations. Especially the presence of intronic or exonic variants within these genes that possibly affect proper pre-mRNA processing poses a challenge as their functional implications are not immediately apparent. Therefore, it appears necessary to characterize potential splicing UCV and to develop appropriate classification tools. We investigated 30 distinct BRCA1 variants, both intronic and exonic, regarding their spliceogenic potential by commonly used in silico prediction algorithms (HSF, MaxEntScan) along with in vitro transcript analyses. A total of 25 variants were identified spliceogenic, either causing/enhancing exon skipping or activation of cryptic splice sites, or both. Except from a single intronic variant causing minor effects on BRCA1 pre-mRNA processing in our analyses, 23 out of 24 intronic variants were correctly predicted by MaxEntScan, while HSF was less accurate in this cohort. Among the 6 exonic variants analyzed, 4 severely impair correct pre-mRNA processing, while the remaining two have partial effects. In contrast to the intronic alterations investigated, only half of the spliceogenic exonic variants were correctly predicted by HSF and/or MaxEntScan. These data support the idea that exonic splicing mutations are commonly disease-causing and concurrently prone to escape in silico prediction, hence necessitating experimental in vitro splicing analysis.

Genetic Testing and Molecular Biomarkers		2012	NOV 2012	16	11	1257-1262	1257	1262							Low use of BRCA counseling and testing services among black women has been reported in several studies, even though such services may play an important role in reducing racial disparities in breast cancer. Surprisingly, little is known about the extent to which black women at high risk for BRCA mutations actually receive recommendations for BRCA counseling. Thus, a primary goal of the current study was to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with the receipt of physician recommendation for genetic counseling based on the self-report of black women at high risk for BRCA mutations. In this cross-sectional study, participants were 125 black women with a family history suggestive of a hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer syndrome. Participants were asked about their receipt of genetic counseling recommendation or referral. Physician recommendation was reported by over two-thirds of the sample. Multivariate analyses revealed that older age and study recruitment source, specifically community-based recruitment, were significantly and independently associated with lower likelihood of physician recommendation. Findings highlight the need for additional research to identify subgroups of high-risk black women among whom physician recommendation of genetic counseling is low but would benefit from such counseling.														1945-0265	1945-0257	10.1089/gtmb.2012.0114

Traditionally, ovarian cancer has been considered to be one disease; however, it is now apparent that it actually consists of many different entities. OSC can be further segregated into two processes: high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) and low-grade serous carcinoma. This classification is supported by molecular changes, morphological appearance, clinical behaviour, and distinct precursor lesions. This review will describe in detail these features of OSC, differential diagnosis, prognosis, and recent challenges to the existing hypotheses regarding the origin of these tumours. Special attention will be paid to HGSC and its relationship with BRCA abnormalities, especially those seen in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Finally, treatment options based on specific molecular targets will be discussed.				Soslow, Robert/0000-0002-7269-5898										0309-0167	1365-2559	10.1111/j.1365-2559.2011.04167.x

Although only about 5% to 10% of all cases of breast cancer are attributable to a highly penetrant cancer predisposition gene, individuals who carry a mutation in one of these genes have a significantly higher risk of developing breast cancer, as well as other cancers, over their lifetime compared with the general population. The ability to distinguish those individuals at high risk allows health care providers to intervene with appropriate counseling and education, surveillance, and prevention-with the overall goal of improved survival for these individuals.

SI	355-363	355	363							Gastric cancer is a global public health concern, ranking as the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality, with a 5-year survival of only 20%. Approximately 10% of gastric cancers appear to have a familial predisposition, and about half of these can be attributed to hereditary germline mutations. We review the genetic syndromes and current standards for genetic counseling, testing, and medical management for screening and treatment of gastric cancer. Recently, germline mutations in the E-cadherin/CDH1 gene have been identified in families with an autosomal dominant inherited predisposition to gastric cancer of the diffuse type. The cumulative lifetime risk of developing gastric cancer in CDH1 mutation carriers is up to 80%, and women from these families also have an increased risk for developing lobular breast cancer. Prophylactic gastrectomies are recommended in unaffected CDH1 mutation carriers, because screening endoscopic examinations and blind biopsies have proven inadequate for surveillance. In addition to this syndrome, gastric cancer risk is elevated in Lynch syndrome associated with germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes and microsatellite instability, in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome due to germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, in familial adenomatous polyposis caused by germline APC mutations, in Li-Fraumeni syndrome due to germline p53 mutations, in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome associated with germline STK11 mutations, and in juvenile polyposis syndrome associated with germline mutations in the SMAD4 and BMPR1A genes. Guidelines for genetic testing, counseling, and management of individuals with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer are suggested. A raised awareness among the physician and genetic counseling communities regarding these syndromes may allow for increased detection and prevention of gastric cancers in these high-risk individuals.														1528-9117	1540-336X	10.1097/PPO.0b013e31826246dc

It has been hypothesised that in a subset of cases t-MNs develop in the context of hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes.Methods The study systematically evaluated pedigrees of patients with t-MNs for cancer incidences and the possibility of a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome. In addition, mutational analyses were performed using constitutional DNA from index patients, and deleterious heterozygous germline mutations were assessed for loss of heterozygosity in sorted leukaemic cells by single nucleotide polymorphism array.Results A nuclear pedigree was obtained in 51/53 patients with t-MNs resulting in a total of 828 individuals analysed. With a standardised incidence ratio of 1.03 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.39), the tumour incidence of first-degree relatives was not increased. However, six pedigrees were suggestive for a hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, three of a Li-Fraumeni like syndrome, and three index patients showed multiple primary neoplasms. Mutational analysis revealed two BRCA1 (c.3112G -> T, c.5251C -> T), one BRCA2 (c.4027A -> G), two BARD1 (C557S) and four TP53 germline mutations (g. 18508 18761delinsGCC, c.847C -> T, c.845_848dupGGCG, c.1146delA) in nine of 53 (17%) index patients with t-MNs. Loss of heterozygosity in leukaemic cells was demonstrated for the BRCA1c.3112G -> T and TP53c.845_848dupGGCG mutations, respectively.Conclusion It is concluded that a proportion of patients with t-MNs carry cancer susceptibility mutations which are likely to contribute to therapy related leukaemogenesis.

This study was undertaken to assess a self-administered family history questionnaire in order to better identify women within a gynecologic oncology practice for referral to genetic counseling services.Methods. Returning patients at an outpatient gynecologic oncology clinic completed a self-administered family health history questionnaire and a detailed telephone interview. A genetic counselor separately assessed blinded information garnered from the questionnaire, structured genetic interview, and electronic medical records to determine whether these data warranted referral to genetic counseling based on established criteria. The structured genetic interview was considered the gold standard to which the questionnaire and medical record information were compared.Results. Of the 45 total participants in the study, 26(58%) were identified from the structured genetic interview as meeting criteria for referral to genetic counseling. The questionnaire identified 21 (81%) of these 26 referrals, while the medical record identified 13 (50%) of these 26 referrals. This led to a 62% increase in referral capture by the questionnaire. The median time to complete the questionnaire was 17 min (range 5-57 min). Thirty-four participants (75.6%) had more family members with cancer identified on the questionnaire compared to the electronic medical record. The questionnaire identified fewer family members with cancer in the five cases that were missed for appropriate referral.Conclusions. Current standard clinical practices are insufficient at identifying patients in need of referral to genetic counseling. A self-administered questionnaire improves recognition of candidates for genetic counseling in a gynecologic oncology practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a procedure that can detect certain germline cancer predisposing mutations present in embryos. The objective of this review was to assess high-risk consumers' knowledge and perceptions of PGD for hereditary cancers. A systematic literature review was conducted through PubMed, Wiley Interscience, PsychInfo, and Cochrane Library databases to identify all articles assessing consumer knowledge and attitudes of PGD for hereditary cancer syndromes. We assessed heterogeneity and the robustness of findings through additional analyses according to study location, hereditary cancer type, and sample size. Thirteen articles remained eligible after the application of specific criteria. Results show a general low level of knowledge about PGD for hereditary cancers, moderate rates of acceptability among high-risk groups, and high levels of need for information about PGD. Individuals in specific risk groups such as those with a personal or family history of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) may benefit from educational information from healthcare professionals about the use of PGD.

(splon@bcm.edu)									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2011	AUG 2011	129	1	221-227	221	227							The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has published guidelines for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOCS) management. Little data exist on compliance with these guidelines among different physician specialties. We performed an on-line case-based survey by randomly sampling physicians from five specialties, Family Medicine (FM), Obstetrics and Gynecology (OG), General Surgery (GS), Internal Medicine (IM), and Hematology and Oncology (HO). The physicians (n = 225) were asked to provide HBOCS management of healthy women ages 40-42 in the presence of a familial BRCA1 mutation. For women negative for the BRCA1 mutation, 59% of the physicians recommended appropriate surveillance although with significant differences among specialties; P = 0.01. Using an aggregate screening intensity score, physicians clearly recommended more intense screening for mutation positive than negative women (P < 0.0001), but only 16% of physicians followed NCCN guidelines for BRCA1-positive women. Seventy-six percent of all physicians recommended breast MRI with significant variation among specialties ranging from 62% of FM to 89% of OG (P = 0.0020). Similarly, 63% of physicians recommended prophylactic oophorectomy, with 76 and 78% of GS and OG compared to 38% of IM (P < 0.0001) and 57% recommended prophylactic mastectomy ranging from 84% of HO to 32% of FM (P < 0.0001). Independent of specialty, respondents with BRCA testing experience recommended more intense management than those without; P = 0.021. Management recommendations of BRCA1 mutation carriers are not consistent with NCCN guidelines and vary by medical specialty and genetic testing experience. Targeted education of physicians by specialty is needed, so that optimal management is offered to these high-risk women.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-011-1449-7

(joanne.weidhaas@yale.edu)									Cancer Research		2010	AUG 15 2010	70	16	6509-6515	6509	6515							Ovarian cancer (OC) is the single most deadly form of women's cancer, typically presenting as an advanced disease at diagnosis in part due to a lack of known risk factors or genetic markers of risk. The KRAS oncogene and altered levels of the microRNA (miRNA) let-7 are associated with an increased risk of developing solid tumors. In this study, we investigated a hypothesized association between an increased risk of OC and a variant allele of KRAS at rs61764370, referred to as the KRAS-variant, which disrupts a let-7 miRNA binding site in this oncogene. Specimens obtained were tested for the presence of the KRAS-variant from nonselected OC patients in three independent cohorts, two independent ovarian case-control studies, and OC patients with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) as well as their family members. Our results indicate that the KRAS-variant is associated with more than 25% of nonselected OC cases. Further, we found that it is a marker for a significant increased risk of developing OC, as confirmed by two independent case-control analyses. Lastly, we determined that the KRAS-variant was present in 61% of HBOC patients without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, previously considered uninformative, as well as in their family members with cancer. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that the KRAS-variant is a genetic marker for increased risk of developing OC, and they suggest that the KRAS-variant may be a new genetic marker of cancer risk for HBOC families without other known genetic abnormalities.

We use MRC-Holland Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to screen for such rearrangements in patients with HBOC and as a first step in our genetic testing workflow. The technique was applied to a set of 310 independent patients and detected eight different copy number alterations, corresponding to 2.6% of the studied samples. MLPA was also found to identify point mutations located in probe sequences. As commercial MLPA tests are not suitable for determining the specific breakpoints or for defining the exact extent of rearrangements, we applied a set of different complementary techniques to characterize these genetic alterations with greater precision. Long-range PCR amplification, RNA analysis, SNP-array chips, non-commercial MLPA probes, and FISH analysis were used to fully define the extent and mechanism of each alteration. In BRCA1, six rearrangements were characterized: deletion of E22, duplication of E9-E24, deletion of E16-E23, deletion of E1-E13, deletion of E1-E2 and duplication of E1-E2. In BRCA2, we studied a deletion of E15-E16 and a deletion of E1-E24. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of the nature and underlying molecular causes of these mutational events in the BRCA1/2 genes.

(ppohl@1fl.cuni.cz)									Neoplasma (Bratislava)		2010		57	3	280-285	280	285							The two major susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are involved in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Early detection of mutation carriers has crucial clinical importance, as it allows identification of women who may benefit from intensive clinical follow-up or prophylactic surgery. Generally accepted inclusion criteria for BRCA1/2 mutation testing are based either upon family history of breast or ovarian cancer or young age at cancer diagnosis. In order to analyze the impact of BRCA1/2 mutations on breast cancer development in the Czech population and to confront the clinical and histopathological data of mutation carriers with current criteria for mutation testing we examined the frequency of mutations in unselected breast cancer cases. Mutational analysis of BRCA1/2 genes performed in 679 unselected female breast cancer patients included all recurrent deleterious alterations previously identified in the Prague area and truncating mutations in the whole exon 11 of BRCA1. Within analyzed gene sequences more than 80% of mutations were identified previously in high-risk patients. A total of 16 breast cancer patients (2.4%) carried a mutation. BRCA1 mutations were identified in 14 (2.1%) whereas BRCA2 in 2 (0.3%) women. Family history of ovarian cancer was a strong predictor of a BRCA1/2 mutation (OR = 8.3; p = 0.01), however, family history of breast cancer was not indicative of carrier status. A significant association between medullary breast cancer and mutation status was observed. Current criteria for BRCA1/2 mutation testing would distinguish only 6 out of 16 (37.5%) carriers identified in our study. Ten breast cancer patients with confirmed BRCA1/2 germ-line mutation exhibited no clinical characteristics that would predict their carrier status. Therefore, we believe that the testing for BRCA1/2 mutations in the Czech Republic may not be restricted only to high-risk patients. Our results indicate that analysis of locally prevalent BRCA1/2 mutations in all breast cancer patients might extend substantially the percentage of identified mutation carriers.

However, the number of detected germline mutations in families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome is lower than expected based upon genetic linkage data. Undetected deleterious mutations in the BRCA genes in some high-risk families are due to the presence of intragenic rearrangements such as deletions, duplications or insertions that span whole exons. This article reviews the molecular aspects of BRCA1 and BRCA2 rearrangements and their frequency among different populations. An overview of the techniques used to screen for large rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2 is also presented.

Although breast cancer is more common among White American (WA) women, incidence rates are higher among young African American (AA) women. Approximately 5-10% of all breast cancer can be accounted for by germline mutations in the breast cancer (BRCA)1 and BRCA2 genes responsible for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. Although genetic counseling (GC) and genetic testing (GT) for HBOC have become widely accepted by the WA population, cancer genetic services are underused among AA. Many investigators have evaluated a wide spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutations in the AA and African population with the possible identification of African founder mutations. Barriers to GC and GT include lack of knowledge and/or negative attitudes regarding genetics and genetics research, and concerns regarding the potential for racial discrimination. It is important for future research to focus on ways in which to eliminate barriers to GC and GT to alleviate disparity in the use of genetic services among high-risk AA women.														1064-3745(print)			978-1-58829-987-1(H)

However, the number of detected germline mutations has been lower than expected based upon genetic linkage data. Undetected deleterious mutations in the BRCA1 gene in some high-risk families could be due to the presence of intragenic rearrangements as deletions, duplications or insertions spanning whole exons. Standard PCR-based screening methods are mainly focused on detecting point mutations and small insertions/deletions, but large rearrangements might escape detection.Methods: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used to examine BRCA1 rearrangements in 172 unrelated patients with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer syndrome without finding deleterious mutation after complete screening of whole coding regions of BRCA1/2 genes. Positive MLPA results were confirmed and located by long-range PCR. The breakpoints of detected rearrangements were characterized by sequencing.Results: Six different large deletions in the BRCA1 gene were identified in 10 out of 172 unrelated high-risk patients: exons 1A/1B and 2 deletion; partial deletion of exon 11 and exon 12; exons 18 and 19 deletion; exon 20 deletion; exons 21 and 22 deletion; and deletion of exons 5 to 14. The breakpoint junctions were localized and further characterized. Destabilization and global unfolding of the mutated BRCT domains explain the molecular and genetic defects associated with the exon 20 in-frame deletion and the exon 21 and 22 in-frame deletion, respectively.Conclusion: Using MLPA, mutations were detected in 6% of high-risk patients previously designated as BRCA1/2 mutation-negative.

Ovarian cancer has one of the highest fractions of hereditary cases. The hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, primarily due to mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, is the main cause of heredity, but also the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome confers an increased risk of ovarian cancer. In order to clarify the contribution of HNPCC to the development of ovarian cancer, we collected data on family history of cancer and characterized MMR function in a consecutive series of 128 tumors unselected for age at diagnosis and previously characterized for BRCA gene mutations.Methods. Expression of the MMR proteins MLH1 PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarray sections. Tumors with reduced staining or loss of staining were also analyzed for microsatellite instability (MSI).Results. Loss of MMR protein expression was identified in 3 ovarian cancers, all of which had a MSI-high phenotype. DNA sequence analysis revealed disease-causing germline mutations (deletions of exons 4-6 in MLHI and a 1-nucleotide deletion in exon 5 of MSH6) in two patients diagnosed at ages 40 and 49 years, both of whom had family histories suggestive of HNPCC. The genetic defect in the third case, which was a 47-year old woman without knowledge about her family history with loss of MLH1/PMS2 expression in the tumor tissue, remains elusive. A family history suggestive of HNPCC was identified in an additional case, but this tumor showed normal, retained MMR protein expression and a microsatellite stable phenotype.Conclusions. About 2% of ovarian cancer is caused by germline mutations in the MMR-genes, a minor proportion as compared to the contribution of the BRCA-genes (11% in the present series). However, identification of HNPCC patients is important since it allows inclusion of high-risk individuals into control programs aimed at preventing the more frequent colorectal and endometrial cancers. Tumors within the HNPCC-spectrum should therefore be included when recording a family history of cancer among patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, little is known of how disruption of BRCA1 functions preferentially increases cancer risk in hormone-dependent organs. We aimed to study whether BRCA1 was regulated by progesterone in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. Materials and Methods: MCF7 breast cancer cells were incubated with 10(-4) or 10(-10) M progesterone for 24 or 48 hours. BRCA1 expression, proliferation and apoptosis were analysed. Results: 10(-4) M progesterone decreased cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. In addition, BRCA1 and cyclin A mRNA decreased. In contrast, none of these effects were observed in MCF7 cells incubated with 10(-10) M progesterone. Conclusion: The down-regulation of BRCA1 in MCF7 cells incubated with 10(-4) M progesterone seems to be a consequence of cell cycle alterations rather than a direct effect of the hormone on BRCA I.														0250-7005	1791-7530

Increased evidence suggests that BRCA1 protein is involved in mammary carcinogenesis in sporadic and hereditary forms. Recent experimental results suggest that BRCA1 plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis. In order to test whether the analysis of human tumors would, provide data supporting this hypothesis in sporadic breast carcinomas, we have investigated the relationship between BRCA1 and apoptosis-related genes. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to determine BRCA1 and the apoptosis-related proteins bcl-2, Bax and p53 in paraffin-embedded tissues of 156 sporadic invasive ductal carcinomas. BRCA1 expression was positively-correlated with Bcl-2 expression (p=0.0008), but no relationship between BRCA1 expression and Bax or p53 expression could be established. In addition, loss of BRCA1 expression was also related to poor tumor differentiation and lymph node metastasis. Our study shows that bcl-2 might be one of the target genes involved in the oncogenesis related to BRCA1. Loss of BRCA1 may contribute to tumor development in breast carcinomas, which may be independent of the p53 tumor suppressor.														0250-7005

It is characterized by a number of genetic aberrations. Some 5-10% of cases are thought to be inherited. The hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome includes genetic alterations of various susceptibility genes, particularly BRCA1 and BRCA2. Breast tumors of patients with germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have more genetic defects than sporadic breast tumors. Here we review new findings in the function of BRCA1 gene function. Accumulation of somatic genetic changes during tumor progression map follows a specific and more aggressive pathway of chromosome damage in these individuals. A major BRCA1 downstream target gene is the DNA damage-responsive gene GADD45. Induction of BRCA1 triggers apoptosis by activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK). BRCA1 interacts with SWI/SNF, a chromatin remodeling complex important in gene expression. Recent advances in genomics and bio-informatics, particularly in DNA-sequencing approaches and DNA-chip technology are expected to improve identification of small molecules, which might be drugable targets. New knowledge about the genetic portrait of breast tumor is coming from differential gene expression profiling using microarrays. Human genome studies, as well as development of "DNA chips," provide a window for observing patterns of gene activity in cells, which will contribute to more accurate cancer classification. However, substantial work connected with analytical and statistical tools must still be carried out to confirm the function of differentially expressed genes. Knowledge of the molecular characteristics of breast tumor has already started to make possible the identification of breast cancer patients who could benefit from therapies that target those features. Progress in basic research into signaling provides the opportunity to attack at least some signal-transduction targets involved in proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance. Exciting knowledge in breast cancer biology is rapidly accumulating in parallel with recent developments in rational selection and validation of relevant targets that provide unique opportunities for development of "intelligent" therapeutics.

However, the widespread use of BRCA1 testing has been limited to date by three principal concerns: the fear of loss of health and life insurance, the uncertain clinical value of a positive test result, and the current lack of an inexpensive and sensitive screening test for BRCA1 mutations. We have developed an inexpensive system for gene mutational scanning, based on a combination of extensive multiplex PCR amplification and two dimensional electrophoresis. The efficiency of this system, as a screening test for BRCA1 mutations, was evaluated in a panel of 60 samples from high risk women, 14 of which contained a previously identified mutation in BRCA1. All 14 mutations were identified, as well as an additional five that had previously escaped detection. In addition to the 19 mutations, a total of 15 different polymorphic variants were scored, most of which were recurring. All were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The cost of screening per sample was calculated to be approximately USdollar sign70 for the manual technique used in this study, and may be reduced to approximately USdollar sign10 with the introduction of commercially available PCR robotics and fluorescent imaging. Implementation of this method of mutation screening in the research and clinical setting should permit rapid accrual of quantitative data on genotype-phenotype associations for the evaluation of diagnostic testing.
