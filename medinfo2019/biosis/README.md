# BIOSIS data set

This data set was created as follows:

1. Using their web search interface, queried the following phrases (using double quotations before and after them):

* Carcinoma, Lobular
* Breast Neoplasms, Male
* Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome
* Breast Carcinoma In Situ

2. Downloaded the results by choosing 

* "Save to other file formats" and then
* Record contents = "Author, Title, Source, Abstract" and 
* File Format = "Tab-Delimited"

Note that the interface allows us download only 500 records at once, so it may need to be repeated by specifying record numbers to fetch.

The number of records for class.

Class | Number of records
------|:----------------:
Carcinoma, Lobular | 1410
Breast Neoplasms, Male | 496
Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome | 114
Breast Carcinoma In Situ | 178
