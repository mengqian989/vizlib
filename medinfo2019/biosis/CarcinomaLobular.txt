A. (l.wessels@nki.nl) ; Jonkers, Jos (j.jonkers@nki.nl)									Cancer Research		2018	OCT 1 2018	78	19	5668-5679	5668	5679							In human cancers, FGFR signaling is frequently hyperactivated by deregulation of FGF ligands or by activating mutations in the FGFR receptors such as gene amplifications, point mutations, and gene fusions. As such, FGFR inhibitors are considered an attractive therapeutic strategy for patients with mutations in FGFR family members. We previously identified Fgfr2 as a key driver of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) in an in vivo insertional mutagenesis screen using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system. Here we explore whether these FGFR-driven ILCs are sensitive to the FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 and use transposon mutagenesis in these tumors to identify potential mechanisms of resistance to therapy. Combined with RNA sequencing-based analyses of AZD4547-resistant tumors, our in vivo approach identified several known and novel potential resistance mechanisms to FGFR inhibition, most of which converged on reactivation of the canonical MAPK-ERK signaling cascade. Observed resistance mechanisms included mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR2, overexpression of MET, inactivation of RASA1, and activation of the drug-efflux transporter ABCG2. ABCG2 and RASA1 were identified only from de novo transposon insertions acquired during AZD4547 treatment, demonstrating that insertional mutagenesis in mice is an effective tool for identifying potential mechanisms of resistance to targeted cancer therapies.Significance: These findings demonstrate that a combined approach of transcriptomics and insertional mutagenesis in vivo is an effective method for identifying potential targets to overcome resistance to therapy in the clinic.

The Loss of E-cadherin is one of the key hallmarks of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a biological process that promotes cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis. Recent evidence has cast doubt on the importance of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in metastasis. The availability of protein-level data in the Cancer Genome Atlas allows for the quantitative analysis of protein and prognosis. The prognostic values of E-cadherin and beta-catenin were revisited across 19 cancer types, and high E-cadherin was found to correlate with good prognosis in most cancers. Conversely, higher E-cadherin and beta-catenin correlated with shorter survival in invasive breast carcinoma. Stratifying breast cancers by histologic subtype revealed that the poor prognosis of E-cadherin and beta-catenin proteins was characteristic of infiltrating ductal, but not lobular, carcinomas. To further corroborate the protein findings and examine cellular Localization, immunohistochemistry was used for E-cadherin and p-catenin in 163 breast patient samples from the Iowa cohort. Most previous studies showing that reduced or absent E-cadherin and beta-catenin was inversely associated with tumor stages in ductal carcinomas were confirmed. Taken together, these results lead us to question the prognostic values of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in ductal carcinomas and indicate a complicated role of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in breast cancer progression.

(mresnick@lifespan.org)									Human Pathology		2018	JUL 2018	77		11-19	11	19							Signet ring morphology is recognized throughout the gastrointestinal tract. However, this pattern may be observed in other primary sites giving rise to diagnostic challenges in the work-up of metastases. Relatively newer immunohistochemical markers have not been evaluated in this context. We assessed expression patterns of several common immunohistochemical markers in tumors with Signet ring morphology to delineate a pragmatic approach to this differential diagnosis. Primary breast and gastrointestinal carcinomas showing Signet ring features were reviewed. Non-mammary and non-gastrointestinal tumors with this morphology were included for comparison. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), E-cadherin, CK7, CK20, GCDFP-15, mammaglobin, CDX2, GATA-3, and HepPar-1 immunohistochemistry was performed. Expression patterns were compared between breast and gastrointestinal tumors as well as lobular breast and gastric tumors. Ninety-three cases were identified: 33 breast carcinomas including 13 lobular, 50 gastrointestinal tumors including 23 gastric, and 10 from other sites. ER (sensitivity=81.8%, specificity = 100%, positive predictive value (PPV) = 100%, negative predictive value (NPV) = 89.3%) and GATA-3 (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 98%, PPV = 96.8%, NPV = 100%) expression were associated with breast origin. CK20 (sensitivity = 66.7%, specificity=93.3%, PPV = 94.1%, NPV = 63.6%) and CDX2 (sensitivity = 72%, specificity = 100%, PPV = 100%, NPV = 68.9%) demonstrated the strongest discriminatory value for gastrointestinal origin. These markers exhibited similar discriminatory characteristics when comparing lobular and gastric signet ring carcinomas. In a limited trial on metastatic breast and gastric cases, these markers successfully discriminated between breast and gastric primary sites in 15 of 16 cases. ER and GATA-3 are most supportive of mammary origin and constitute an effective panel for distinguishing primary breast from primary gastrointestinal Signet ring tumors when combined with CK20 and CDX2 immunohistochemistry.

B.; Diaz, Roberto (Roberto.Diaz@moffitt.org)									European Journal of Cancer		2018	JUL 2018	98		48-58	48	58							Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease, but recent studies have identified heterogeneity in patient outcomes. However, the utility of histologic subtyping in TNBC has not yet been well-characterised. This study utilises data from the National Cancer Center Database (NCDB) to complete the largest series to date investigating the prognostic importance of histology within TNBC.Methods: A total of 729,920 patients (pts) with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC), medullary breast carcinoma (MedBC), adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) or apocrine breast carcinoma (ABC) treated between 2004 and 2012 were identified in the NCDB. Of these, 89,222 pts with TNBC that received surgery were analysed. KaplaneMeier analysis, log-rank testing and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression were utilised with overall survival (OS) as the primary outcome.Results: MBC (74.1%), MedBC (60.6%), ACC (75.7%), ABC (50.1%) and ILC (1.8%) had significantly different proportions of triple negativity when compared to IDC (14.0%, p < 0.001). TNBC predicted an inferior OS in IDC (p < 0.001) and ILC (p < 0.001). Lumpectomy and radiation (RT) were more common in MedBC (51.7%) and ACC (51.5%) and less common in MBC (33.1%) and ILC (25.4%), when compared to IDC (42.5%, p < 0.001). TNBC patients with MBC (HR 1.39, p < 0.001), MedBC (HR 0.42, p < 0.001) and ACC (HR 0.32, p = 0.003) differed significantly in OS when compared to IDC.Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that histologic heterogeneity in TNBC significantly informs patient outcomes and thus, has the potential to aid in the development of optimum personalised treatments.

Of the 603 patients, 369 (61.2%) underwent MR imaging. The authors calculated the MR detection rate of additional lesions that were occult at mammography and ultrasonography and analyzed any alterations in surgical management. After propensity score matching, 196 pairs of patients were allocated to the groups, and the 17 possible confounding variables regarding patient and tumor characteristics and various clinical features were well balanced between the patients who underwent MR imaging and those who did not. Surgical outcomes were compared.Results: Of the 369 patients who underwent MR imaging, additional lesions were detected in 145 (39.3%); 95 of the 145 patients (65.5%) had malignant lesions. A change in surgical management occurred because of MR findings in 94 of the 369 patients (25.5%). According to pathologic findings, this change was appropriate for 84 of the 94 patients (89.4%). In the propensity score-matched analysis, breast MR imaging was associated with lower odds of repeat surgery (odds ratio, 0.140; P < .001) and similar likelihood of initial mastectomy (odds ratio, 0.876; P = .528) and final mastectomy (odds ratio, 0.744; P = .151) compared with patients without breast MR imaging.Conclusion: Preoperative MR imaging is useful for detecting additional synchronous malignancy and significantly reducing the likelihood of repeat surgery without increasing the rate of mastectomy in patients with ILC.

Immunohistochemical phenotype was examined. The clinicopathological relevance of the topographical pattern of SA-BCs was analysed.Results Overall, up to 46 patients (25.6%) had contralateral cancer, either SA associated or not. Of 99 cases who underwent core needle biopsy (CNB), 36 were underestimated as adenosis or atypical ductal hyperplasia at CNB, 5 invasive cases were misinterpreted as in situ carcinomas, whereas 4 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cases were overdiagnosed as invasive carcinoma. Microscopically, 163 tumours were in situ, including 136 DCIS, 19 lobular carcinomas in situ (LCIS) and 8 mixed DCIS/LCIS; of these carcinomas in situ (CIS), 37 had microinvasion. The DCIS group exhibited low, intermediate and high grades in 53.7%, 34.6% and 11.8% of cases, respectively, mostly with solid (43.4%) or cribriform (41.9%) pattern. Forty out of 43 invasive cases were invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), mostly DCIS predominant. Immunophenotypically, luminal A phenotype was identified in 55.1%, 63.2% and 45.0% of DCIS, LCIS and IDC cases, respectively. Topographical type A group (carcinoma being entirely confined to SA, n=176) was characterised by smaller size, less invasiveness, lower grade and more frequency of luminal A immunophenotype compared with type B group ( 50% but not all of the carcinomatous lesion being located in SA, n=30) (all P<0.05).Conclusions CIS, especially non-high-grade DCIS, represents the most common variant of SA-BC, and luminal A is the most predominant immunophenotype. CNB assessment might be challenging in some SA-BCs. The topographical pattern has great clinicopathological relevance. Careful evaluation of the contralateral breast and long-term follow-up for patients with SA-BC is necessary given its high prevalence of bilaterality.														0021-9746	1472-4146	10.1136/jclinpath-2017-204751

Metastases to the GI tract may arise many years after initial diagnosis and can affect the tract from the tongue to the anus, stomach being the most commonly involved site. Clinical presentations are predominantly nonspecific, and rarely asymptomatic. CEA, CA 15-3, and CA 19-9 may be informative for symptomatic patients who have had a previous history of breast cancer.Case presentation:We introduce the case of asymptomatic colonic metastasis from breast carcinoma in a 67-year-old woman followed-up for Luminal A ILC. Diagnosis was performed through positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan and contrast-enhancement spectral mammography (CESM), steering endoscopist to spot the involved intestinal tract and in ruling out further dissemination in the breast parenchyma.Conclusion:In colonic metastases, tumor markers might not be totally reliable. In asymptomatic cases, clinical conditions might be underappreciated, missing local or distant recurrence. CT and PET/CT scan might be useful in diagnosing small volume diseases, and steering endoscopist toward GI metastasis originating from the breast. CESM represents a tolerable and feasible tool that rules out multicentricity and multifocality of breast localization. Moreover, particular patients could tolerate it better than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

A marker is yet needed to distinguish this in the case of the GATA3-positive tumor of unknown origin. We tested classical markers of breast differentiation and hormonal signaling to see which correlated strongest with GATA3 expression in breast cancer and thus which could help correctly identify breast origin in the case of the GATA3-positive tumor of unknown origin. GATA3, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, androgen receptor (AR), HER2, GCDFP15, and mammaglobin expression was intercorrelated in a histologically diverse 259-case breast cancer tissue microarray. We show herein a uniquely high level of correlation between GATA3 and AR expression (r = 0.61; 95% confidence interval 0.52-0.68) that was strongest among lobular carcinomas (r = 1; 95% confidence interval 0.73-1) and stronger than any other correlation studied. Separate AR staining of 10 metastatic GATA3+ carcinomas of urothelial origin and 13 metastatic GATA3+ carcinomas of breast origin showed that strong AR staining (>60% of tumor cells) has a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 100% for correctly distinguishing GATA3+ carcinoma of mammary origin from urothelial origin in the metastatic setting. Androgen receptor expression is strongly correlated with GATA3 in breast cancer, particularly in tumors with lobular morphology. Strong AR expression (>60% of tumor cells) is an excellent test to rule out urothelial carcinoma in the GATA3+ metastatic setting (specificity 100%) and will effectively identify breast origin in approximately 50% of cases.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the concentrations and activities of selected haemostatic parameters in the plasma of patients diagnosed with breast cancer (BrCa) and to make an attempt at finding associations with their levels and selected clinicopathological factors; clinical classification, histological grading, and molecular subtype of BrCa. The study involved 145 Caucasian ethnicity women. Eighty-five women aged 45-66 with primary BrCa without distant metastases (M0). Inclusion criteria were as follows: histopathological examination confirming the diagnosis of primary BrCa, without previous radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The control group consisted of 60, post-menopausal women, aged 45-68. Haemostatic profile expressed by concentrations and activities of tissue factor (TF) and its inhibitor (TFPI) as well as concentrations of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) were measured applying immunoassay techniques. A significantly higher concentration of PAI-1 was noted in patients with BrCa localized in the left breast. We observed significantly lower activity of TFPI and significantly higher concentration of PAI-1 in the group of patients with invasive ductal carcinoma as compared with invasive lobular carcinoma. A significantly higher concentration of t-PA in patients with pT2 BrCa in relation to pT1 cases was noted. Based on comprehensive analysis of haemostatic profile depending on clinicopathological features, we suggest that haemostatic parameters play crucial roles in invasion and metastases of malignant tumours.

(nmoatamed@mednet.ucla.edu)									PLoS One		2018	APR 19 2018	13	4	Article No.: e0195958	e0195958								BackgroundImmune checkpoint regulators, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death protein-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) have emerged as promising new targets for cancer therapeutics. While tumor expression of PD-L1 has been shown to have objective responses to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies, the clinical implications of CTLA-4 expression in tumor cells or immune cells in the tumor microenvironment is still controversial. We investigated the expression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 in human breast tumors and provided a scoring system for the systematic evaluation of CTLA-4 staining.MethodsImmunohistochemical staining for PD-L1 and CTLA-4 expression was performed on a tissue microarray of 102 cores, which included normal and neoplastic breast tissues. Neoplastic cores were divided into four groups: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and invasive tubular carcinoma (ITC). PD-L1 and CTLA-4 expressions were scored based on a system which accounted for the percentage and intensity of positivity and results provided in conjunction with available clinical and demographic data.ResultsOverall, CTLA-4 was over-expressed in 49 of 93 (52.7%) breast tumors. Subcategorically, CTLA-4 was positive in 3 of 8 (37.5%) ductal carcinoma in situ, 40 of 73 (55%) of invasive ductal carcinomas, 4 of 10 (40%) of invasive lobular carcinomas and 2 of 2 (100%) of invasive tubular carcinomas. All 6 normal breast tissues were interpreted as negative for CTLA-4 staining. Only 4.1% of the invasive ductal carcinomas were positive for PD-L1 reactivity and the remaining carcinomas stained negative.ConclusionsThis study shows a significant overexpression of CTLA-4 in >50% of breast carcinomas with no such overexpression of CTLA-4 in benign breast tissues. PDL-1 staining is seen in only a small number of invasive ductal carcinomas (4.1%). These findings suggest the need for further investigation of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies and their efficacy in the treatment of breast carcinomas with overexpression of these immune modulators. In addition, the proposed scoring system will facilitate a more systematic correlation between tumor reactivity and clinical outcome which can be applied to all intracytoplasmic tumor markers.

Different methods have been used to determine the SLN status intraoperatively, e.g. frozen section histology (FS) and touch imprint cytology (TIC). The sensitivity of intraoperative TIC examination on SLN is not consistent between different studies and varies according to different tumor histologic subtypes, tumor size and the age of the patient. The aim of this study was to describe the specificity and sensitivity of TIC and to compare TIC sensitivity in the different histological subtypes of breast carcinoma.MethodsA retrospective review was performed of 1227 consecutive clinically node negative breast cancer patients treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with intraoperative TIC between the years 2003 and 2008. The SLN was bisected and stained using the May-Grun-wald-Giemsa method and immunocytochemically with the antibody MNF-116.ResultsThe overall sensitivity of the TIC test was 68.6% and the specificity was 99.8%. There was no statistically significant difference between the detection of SLN metastases from ductal carcinoma versus lobular carcinoma. The sensitivity improved over the period of the study.ConclusionTIC is highly specific with an acceptable overall sensitivity. The sensitivity increased under the period of the study and it was higher in cases with larger size of the primary tumor. There was no difference in TIC sensitivity between the different histological subtypes.														1932-6203	1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0195560

This study investigated their antitumoral effects 'per se', using a mathematical model validated on experimental data.Methods OLN were prepared and characterized either in vitro or in vivo. TUBO cells, established from a lobular carcinoma of a BALB-neuT mouse, were investigated following 48 h of incubation in the absence/presence of different concentrations of OLN. OLN internalization, cell viability, necrosis, apoptosis, cell cycle and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were checked as described in the Method section.In vivo tumor growth was evaluated after subcutaneous transplant in BALB/c mice of TUBO cells either without treatment or after 24 h incubation with 10% v/v OLN.Results OLN showed sizes of about 350 nm and a positive surface charge (45 mV). Dose-dependent TUBO cell death through ROS-triggered apoptosis following OLN internalization was detected. A mathematical model predicting the effects of OLN uptake was validated on both in vitro and in vivo results.Conclusions Due to their intrinsic toxicity OLN might be considered an adjuvant tool suitable to deliver their therapeutic cargo intracellularly and may be proposed as promising combined delivery system.

Retrospective series of pure ALH and LCIS reported "upgrade" rate to DCIS or invasive cancer in 0-40%. Few reports document radiologic/pathologic correlation to exclude cases of discordance that are the likely source of most upgrades, and there is minimal data on outcomes with follow-up imaging and clinical surveillance.Cases of LN alone on CNB (2001-2014) were reviewed. CNB yielding LN with other pathologic findings for which surgery was indicated were excluded. All patients had either surgical excision or clinical follow-up with breast imaging. All cases included were subject to radiologic-pathologic correlation after biopsy.178 cases were identified out of 62213 (0.3%). 115 (65%) patients underwent surgery, and 54 (30%) patients had surveillance for > 12 months (mean = 55 months). Of the patients who underwent surgical excision, 13/115 (11%) were malignant. Eight of these 13 found malignancy at excision when CNB results were considered discordant (5 DCIS, and 3 invasive lobular carcinoma), with the remainder, 5/115 (4%), having a true pathologic upgrade: 3 DCIS, and 2 microinvasive lobular carcinoma. Among 54 patients not having excision, 12/54 (22%) underwent subsequent CNB with only 1 carcinoma found at the initial biopsy site.Surgical excision of LN yields a low upgrade rate when careful consideration is given to radiologic/pathologic correlation to exclude cases of discordance. Observation with interval breast imaging is a reasonable alternative for most cases.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-017-4629-2

James									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2018	FEB 2018	168	1	29-34	29	34							Oncotype Dx (ODx) is a multigene assay that is prognostic and predictive in estrogen receptor (ER) positive early breast cancer. ODx recurrence score (RS) is reported to be histologic grade dependent. Relationship of RS with breast cancer histologic subtypes is unknown. This study was designed to assess the relationship of histologic subtype with RS. Histologic grade dependence of RS was also investigated.Results of consecutive ODx tests (1/2007-7/2016) from two institutions were reviewed. Histologic subtypes (in: Lakhani et al., WHO classification, IARC Press, Lyon, 2012), combined Nottingham histologic grade, age and tumor size were recorded from pathology reports. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between RS and ODx risk categories and histologic subtypes, grade, age and tumor size.RS was grade dependent. RS of grade 1 and grade 2 tumors were significantly lower than grade 3 tumors. There was no high-risk grade 1 tumor. In favorable histologic subtypes there was no high-risk tumor. Mean RS of grade 1 lobular tumors was significantly higher than grade 1 ductal tumors. Using newer ODx cut-offs, 5 grade 1 tumors were reclassified as high risk (RS > 25) and grade 3 lobular tumors showed significantly higher rate of reclassification as high-risk than grade 3 ductal tumors. In a multivariate analysis, only grade showed a significant positive correlation with RS. Adding dichotomous histologic subtyping (favorable vs. non-favorable) to grade further improved correlation with RS.The Oncotype Dx result is impacted by histologic grade and histologic subtype. Tumors with favorable histologic subtypes and histologic grade 1 tumors do not have high-risk RS. High RS in a grade 1 tumor or in a tumor with favorable histology is unusual that warrants further investigation. Invasive lobular carcinomas rarely show high-risk RS. Histologic grade and histologic subtype should be considered while ordering ODx testing.

The prevalence of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), the second most common type of breast cancer, accounts for 5%-15% of all invasive breast cancer cases. Its histological feature to spread in rows of single cell layers explains why it often fails to form a palpable lesion and the lack of sensitivity of mammography and ultrasound (US) to detect it. It also has a higher incidence of multifocal, multicentric, and contralateral disease when compared to the other histological subtypes. Ihe clinicopathologic features and outcomes of Invasive Ductolobular Carcinoma (IDLC) are very similar to the ILC. The purpose of our study is to assess the importance of MRI in the preoperative management and staging of patients affected by ILC or IDLC. Materials and Methods. We identified women diagnosed with ILC or IDLC. We selected the patients who had preoperative breast MRI. For each patient we identified the areas of multifocal, multicentric, or contralateral disease not visible to standard exams and detected by preoperative MRI. We analyzed the potential correlation between additional cancer areas and histological cancer markers. Results. Of the 155 women who met our inclusion criteria, 93 (60%) had additional cancer areas detected by MRI. In 61 women, 39,4% of the overall population, the additional cancer areas were confirmed by US/tomosynthesis second look and biopsy. Presurgical MRI staging changed surgical management in the 37,4% of the patients. Only six patients of the overall population needed a reoperation after the initial surgery. No statistically significant correlation was found between MRI overestimation and the presence of histological peritumoral vascular/infatic invasion. No statistically significant correlation was found between additional cancer areas and histological cancer markers. Conclusions. Our study suggests that MRI is an important tool in the preoperative management and staging of patients affected by lobular or ductolobular invasive carcinoma.

(Birgittte.Bruun.Rasmussen@regionh.dk)									Acta Oncologica (Stockholm)		2018		57	1	67-73	67	73							Background: Cell culture studies have disclosed that the mitotic Aurora kinase A is causally involved in both tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor resistant cell growth and thus may be a potential new marker for endocrine resistance in the clinical setting.Material and methods: Archival tumor tissue was available from 1323 Danish patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive primary breast cancer, who participated in the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trial, comparing treatment with tamoxifen and letrozole and both in a sequence. The expression of Aurora A was determined by immunohistochemistry in 980 tumors and semi quantitively scored into three groups; negative/weak, moderate and high. The Aurora A expression levels were compared to other clinico-pathological parameters and outcome, defined as disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).Results: High expression of Aurora A was found in 26.9% of patients and moderate in 57.0%. High expression was significantly associated with high malignancy grade and HER2 amplification. High Aurora A expression was significantly more frequent in ductal compared to lobular carcinomas. We found no significant association between Aurora A expression and DFS or OS and no evidence of interaction between Aurora A expression and benefits from tamoxifen versus letrozole.Conclusions: Aurora A expression in breast tumors was associated with high malignancy grade III and with HER2 amplification. A trend as a prognostic factor for OS was found in patients with high Aurora A expression. No predictive property was observed in this study with early breast cancer.														0284-186X	1651-226X	10.1080/0284186X.2017.1404126																		
J	BCI:BCI201800282461	29035379			Lobular carcinoma in situ and invasive lobular breast cancer are characterized by enhanced expression of transcription factor AP-2 beta		Raap, Mieke; Gronewold, Malte; Christgen, Henriette; Glage, Silke; Bentires-Alj, Mohammad; Koren, Shany; Derksen, Patrick W.; Boelens, Mirjam; Jonkers, Jos; Lehmann, Ulrich; Feuerhake, Friedrich; Kuehnle, Elna; Gluz, Oleg; Kates, Ronald; Nitz, Ulrike; Harbeck, Nadia; Kreipe, Hans H.; Christgen, Matthias (Christgen.Matthias@MH-Hannover.de)									Laboratory Investigation		2018	JAN 2018	98	1	117-129	117	129							Transcription factor AP-2 beta (TFAP2B) regulates embryonic organ development and is overexpressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare childhood malignancy. Gene expression profiling has implicated AP-2 beta in breast cancer (BC). This study characterizes AP-2 beta expression in the mammary gland and in BC. AP-2 beta protein expression was assessed in the normal mammary gland epithelium, in various reactive, metaplastic and pre-invasive neoplastic lesions and in two clinical BC cohorts comprising >2000 patients. BCs from various genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models were also evaluated. Human BC cell lines served as functional models to study siRNA-mediated inhibition of AP-2 beta. The normal mammary gland epithelium showed scattered AP-2 beta-positive cells in the luminal cell layer. Various reactive and pre-invasive neoplastic lesions, including apocrine metaplasia, usual ductal hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) showed enhanced AP-2 beta expression. Cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) were more often AP-2 beta-negative (P < 0.001). In invasive BC cohorts, AP-2 beta-positivity was associated with the lobular BC subtype (P < 0.001), loss of E-cadherin (Po0.001), a positive estrogen receptor (ER) status (Po0.001), low Ki67 (P < 0.001), low/intermediate Oncotype DX recurrence scores (Po0.001), and prolonged event-free survival (P = 0.003). BCs from GEM models were all AP-2 beta-negative. In human BC cell lines, AP-2 beta expression was independent from ER-signaling. SiRNA-mediated inhibition of AP-2 beta diminished proliferation of lobular BC cell lines in vitro. In summary, AP-2 beta is a new mammary epithelial differentiation marker. Its expression is preferentially retained and enhanced in LCIS and invasive lobular BC and has prognostic implications. Our findings indicate that AP-2 beta controls tumor cell proliferation in this slow-growing BC subtype.														0023-6837	1530-0307	10.1038/labinvest.2017.106

(troester@email.unc.edu)									Cancer Causes & Control		2018	JAN 2018	29	1	25-32	25	32							Background Invasive lobular breast tumors display unique reproductive risk factor profiles. Lobular tumors are predominantly Luminal A subtype, and it is unclear whether reported risk factor associations are independent of molecular subtype.Methods Polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the associations between risk factors and histologic subtype [ductal (n = 2,856), lobular (n = 326), and mixed ductal-lobular (n = 473)] in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (1993-2013). Three-marker immunohistochemical clinical subtypes were defined as Luminal A (ER+ or PR+/HER2-), Luminal B (ER+ or PR+/HER2+), Triple Negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-), and HER2+ (ER-/PR-/HER2+).Results In case-case analyses compared to ductal, lobular tumors were significantly associated with lactation duration > 12 months [OR 1.86, 95% CI (1.33-2.60)], age at first birth >= 26 years [OR: 1.35, 95% CI: (1.03-1.78)], and current oral contraceptive use [OR: 1.86, 95% CI: (1.08-3.20)]. Differences in risk factor associations between ductal and lobular tumors persisted after restricting to Luminal A subtype.Conclusions Lobular tumors were associated with older age at first birth, increased lactation duration, and current oral contraceptive use. Etiologic heterogeneity by histology persisted after restricting to Luminal A subtype, suggesting both tumor histology and intrinsic subtype play integral parts in breast cancer risk.

Blood		2017	DEC 7 2017	130	Suppl. 1	5376	5376								PURPOSECombined positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a well-established technique for diagnostic workups of multiple myeloma that can detect intramedullary as well extramedullary disease. However, PET-CT frequently reveals incidental findings, often necessitating additional workup. The present study is focused on clinically significant incidental findings on PET-CT scans in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, leading to additional diagnostic measures with the resulting outcome.PATIENTS AND METHODSWe reviewed medical records of consecutive patients with plasma cell dyscrasias that were diagnosed from 2012 to 2017 and that had a staging PET-CT at diagnosis. Only the initial PET-CT report was reviewed. Clinically significant incidental finding (CSIF) is defined as any finding that was new and needed further investigation or follow up. Myeloma-related osseous findings and extramedullary plasmacytomas were not considered as incidental findings. All CSIFs were further classified as unequivocal if the finding was previously unknown, definitive and did not require any workup or equivocal if it required further workup, such as review of previous medical records, imaging or tissue diagnosis.RESULTSA total of 470 patients consented and had completed follow-up. Of these, 15.5% (n=73) showed CSIF; 2.7% (n=13) were unequivocal and 12.8% (n=60) were classified as equivocal. Based on review of the medical records, 10 were true positive (most common findings were abdominal aortic aneurysm and hiatal hernia) and 3 were false positive (Flow Sheet). In 12.8% (n=60), findings were equivocal and these were further classified into those requiring clinical correlation/review of previous imaging (4.5%; n=21) and those which required subsequent investigative workup, including imaging procedures and biopsies (8.3%; n=39)(Flow Sheet). Among the 21 cases that required clinical correlation or review of previous imaging, 17 were falsely positive and 4 showed diagnosis of Hepatic angioma, PCP pneumonia, thyroid nodule, gastritis. Thirty-nine cases of equivocal findings required further investigation. Twenty-three cases had nonbiopsy-based investigations yielding 12 truly positive and 11 falsely positive findings. The most common true positive finding was hydronephrosis requiring emergent nephrostomy tube and pituitary macroadenoma. Sixteen patients proceeded to a tissue diagnosis, with 10 truly positive and 6 falsely positive. The most common true positive finding on biopsy was thyroid malignancy. Incidental discovery of other primary malignancies due to PET-CT included lobular carcinoma of the breast, prostate adenocarcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinomas and neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. Overall, only 1% (5/470, 95% CI 0-2%) of all patients evaluated with PET-CT scan as initial workup for plasma cell dyscrasia were found to have another primary malignancy.CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, incidental findings on PET scans may be related to a benign process, infection, malignancy or may be falsely positive but finding another primary malignancy is rare. High positive predictive value (58.3%) among equivocal findings in our study suggests that it is important to investigate whenever clinical suspicion is strong. The overall rate of incidental finding was consistent with other studies evaluating the use of PET-CT scans in malignancies. Further prospective studies will be required to identify uniform standards for the further evaluation of incidental findings of PET-CT scans.[GRAPHICS].														0006-4971	1528-0020																			
J	BCI:BCI201800069361	28574280			Current Concepts in Diagnosis, Molecular Features, and Management of Lobular Carcinoma In Situ of the Breast With a Discussion of Morphologic Variants		Ginter, Paula S.; D'Alfonso, Timothy M. (tid9007@med.cornell.edu)									Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine		2017	DEC 2017	141	12	1668-1678	1668	1678							Context.-Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) refers to a neoplastic proliferation of cells that characteristically shows loss of E-cadherin expression and has long been regarded as a risk factor for invasive breast cancer. Longterm outcome studies and molecular data have also implicated LCIS as a nonobligate precursor to invasive carcinoma. In the past few decades, pleomorphic and florid LCIS have been recognized as morphologic variants of LCIS with more-aggressive histopathologic features, less-favorable biomarker profiles, and more-complex molecular features compared with classic LCIS. There is still a lack of consensus regarding certain aspects of managing patients with LCIS.Objectives.-To review recently published literature on LCIS and to provide an overview of the current morphologic classification of LCIS, recent molecular advances, and trends in patient management.Data Sources.-Sources included peer-reviewed, published journal articles in PubMed (US National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland) and published guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (Fort Washington, Pennsylvania).Conclusions.-Lobular carcinoma in situ represents a marker for increased risk of breast cancer, as well as a nonobligate precursor to invasive carcinoma. Morphologic variants of LCIS-florid and pleomorphic LCIS-are genetically more-complex lesions and are more likely to be associated with invasive carcinoma. Further investigation into which molecular alterations in LCIS are associated with progression to invasive carcinoma is needed to help guide medical and surgical management.														0003-9985	1543-2165	10.5858/arpa.2016-0421-RA

Three healthy volunteers ages 31-36 years were also imaged. Fast-MSOT was based on unique single-frame-per-pulse (SFPP) image acquisition employed to improve the accuracy of spectral differentiation over using a small number of wavelengths. Breast tissue was illuminated at the 700-970 nm spectral range over 0.56 seconds total scan time. MSOT data were guided by ultrasonography and X-ray mammography or MRI.Results: The extended spectral range allowed the computation of oxygenated hemoglobin (HBO2), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HB), total blood volume (TBV), lipid, and water contributions, allowing first insights into in vivo high-resolution breast tissue MSOT cancer patterns. TBV and Hb/HBO2 images resolved marked differences between cancer and control tissue, manifested as a vessel-rich tumor periphery with highly heterogeneous spatial appearance compared with healthy tissue. We observe significant TBV variations between different tumors and between tumors over healthy tissues. Water and fat lipid layers appear disrupted in cancer versus healthy tissue; however, offer weaker contrast compared with TBV images.Conclusions: In contrast to optical methods, MSOT resolves physiologic cancer features with high resolution and revealed patterns not offered by other radiologic modalities. The new features relate to personalized and precision medicine potential. (C) 2017 AACR.														1078-0432	1557-3265	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-3200

(jepstein@jhmi.edu)									American Journal of Surgical Pathology		2017	NOV 2017	41	11	1570-1575	1570	1575							Plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a rare variant of UC that can histologically mimic metastatic cancer involving the urinary bladder. A total of 45 cases of plasmacytoid UC were collected and reviewed histologically. The following immunohistochemical markers were performed: CDX2; polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (p-CEA); gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15); mammaglobin; estrogen receptor (ER); progesterone receptor (PR); GATA 3 and uroplakin II. In all cases, the plasmacytoid variant of UC lacked expression of ER and mammaglobin. In contrast, GCPDFP-15, PR, CDX2 and p-CEA showed positive staining in 11 (24.4%), 6 (13.3%), 8 (17.7%), and 22 (48.8%) cases, respectively. GCPDFP-15 was expressed in 4/8 female cases with 1 concurrently focally (+ 2) expressing PR. GATA 3 and uroplakin II was positive in 37/45 cases (82.2%) and 15/45 (33.3%) cases, respectively. A tissue microarray with 40 cases of infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast was stained for uroplakin II, and was negative in all cases. Tissue microarrays with 46 cases of gastric signet ring cell adenocarcinomas were all negative for GCDFP-15, ER, PR, GATA3, uroplakin II, and mammaglobin. A panel of stains including mammaglobin, ER, and uroplakin II is recommended to exclude metastatic lobular breast carcinoma to the bladder in cases where a conventional UC component is not present. Immunohistochemistry for CDX2 and p-CEA cannot be utilized to differentiate signet ring cell adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract from plasmacytoid UC; GATA3 or uroplakin II immunoreactivity can rule out a gastric primary given their negativity in signet ring cell adenocarcinoma of the stomach.														0147-5185	1532-0979																			
J	BCI:BCI201800056642	28755148			Amplification and overexpression of PSCA at 8q24 in invasive micropapillary carcinoma of breast		Meng, Fanfan; Liu, Bingbing; Xie, Gan; Song, Yawen; Zheng, Xia; Qian, Xiaolong; Li, Shuai; Jia, Hongqin; Zhang, Xinmin; Zhang, Lanjing; Yang, Yi-ling (yyling10@163.com) ; Fu, Li (fulijyb@hotmail.com)									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2017	NOV 2017	166	2	383-392	383	392							Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) of the breast has distinct histological features and molecular genetic profiles. Gains/amplifications of 8q24 are found associated with IMPC. Although the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) gene is located at chromosome 8q24, and found over-expressed in prior studies, its prognostic values and biological significance in IMPC have not been well studied.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to assess the frequencies of PSCA copy number gains in IMPC, invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (IDC-NST), and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) samples. The protein expression levels of PSCA were examined in 56 IMPC, 72 IDC-NST, and 56 ILC samples using immunohistochemical analysis.PSCA gene amplification was detected in 45.2% (14/31) of the IMPC, 28.1% (9/32) of the IDC-NST, and none (0/25) of the ILC. PSCA protein expression was observed in 58.9% (33/56), 40.3% (29/72), and 3.6% (2/56) of IMPC, IDC-NST, and ILC samples, respectively. The concordant rate of the immunohistochemistry and FISH data was 85.2%. PSCA gene amplification highly correlated with its protein overexpression (rs = 0.687, P < 0.001), suggesting that gene amplification is an important mechanism involved in PSCA overexpression. Our univariate analysis showed that the patients with PSCA-positive IMPC had a decreased disease-free survival (DFS) compared to PSCA-negative IMPC patients (P = 0.003). Our multivariate analysis confirmed the worse DFS in PSCA-positive IMPC patients (P = 0.022).Our results indicate that PSCA may be an attractive target in the 8q24 amplicon and that it may serve as a molecular marker of metastasis and recurrence in IMPC. The differential expression of PSCA may be associated with cell adhesion. Detection of PSCA protein and gene amplification may help manage and predict the prognosis of IMPC patients.

Protein expression and its correlation with clinicopatholgic variables were statistically analyzed.Results: ISL-1 and DNMT3B were highly expressed in ILC (p<0.001) and tumoral 5-meC was highly expressed in IDC (p=0.006). DNMT1 (p<0.001) showed higher expression rate in luminal A type ILC. ISL-1 and DNMT3B showed higher expression rate in both luminal A type and luminal B type of ILC (p<0.05). In IDC, tumoral 5-meC commonly showed high positivity (p=0.039). On univariate analysis, shorter disease-free survival of ILC was associated with DNMT1 high positivity (p=0.001) and ISL-1 positivity (p=0.018).Conclusion: DNA methylation-related proteins are differentially expressed in ILC and IDC, and DNMT1, DNMT3B and ISL-1 show high expression rate in ILC.

The role of the 21-gene Recurrence Score (RS) has not been clearly defined for ILC. We sought to determine the prognostic value of RS and the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on long-term survival in patients with ILC.Utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database from 2004 to 2013, we identified records of women aged 18-74 years, diagnosed with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive ILC (stage I to III) with RS available. We categorized patients into risk groups based on the traditional RS cutoffs and into those of the Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment (TAILORx). Five-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models.Of the 7316 women included, 21% were in the low-risk; 71%, intermediate-risk; and 8%, high-risk groups as per TAILORx RS cutoffs. The 5-year BCSS was 99% in the low-risk, 99% in the intermediate-risk, and 96% in the high-risk groups. A high-risk RS as per TAILORx cutoff was independently associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio [HR] of death 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-4.95) when compared to a low-risk RS. In both the high-risk and intermediate-risk groups, adjuvant chemotherapy was not significantly associated with the HR of death (high-risk, HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.55-2.38; intermediate-risk, HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.62-1.87).For patients with ER-positive ILC, 8% were in the high-risk and 72% were in the intermediate-risk groups as per the TAILORx RS cutoffs. In the high-risk group, the RS predicted a lower 5-year BCSS. Adjuvant chemotherapy did not seem to confer a survival benefit for either the intermediate- or the high-risk cohorts.

The maximally selected Log-Rank statistics analysis was applied to Ki67 continuous variable to estimate the appropriate cut-off. The Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot (STEPP) analysis was performed as well.Results: Data from overall 1097 (457/222 ILC: training/validation set; 418 IDC) patients were gathered. The identified optimal Ki67 cut-offs were 4% and 14% for DFS in ILC and IDC cohort, respectively. In ILC patients, the Ki67 cut-off was an independent OS predictor. Ten-years OS and DFS were 89.9% and 77.2% (p = 0.007) and 79.4% and 69.2% (p = 0.03) for patients with Ki67 < 4% and > 4%, respectively. In IDC patients, 10-years OS was 93.8% and 71.7%, p = 0.02, DFS was 84.0% and 52.6%, p = 0.0003, for patients with Ki67 <= 14% and > 14%, respectively. In the validation set, the optimal Ki67 OS cut-off was 5%. The STEPP analysis showed that in the presence of low Ki67 values, IDC patients have a better DFS than ILC patients, while with the increase of values the prognosis tends to overlap.Conclusions: Despite the retrospective design of the study, the prognostic relevance of Ki67 (as well as its optimal cut-off) seems to significantly differ according to breast cancer histology.

The Black ILC patients presented a higher rate of advanced histological grades and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stages, a higher rate of lymph node (LN) involvement and a lower rate of progesterone receptors (PR)-positivity than the White patients and other races. The five-year overall survival (OS) and five-year breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) were worst in the Black patients among these patients (85.5%, 76.0% and 87.7%, P<0.01; 91.1%, 84.4% and 91.6%, P<0.01). Multivariate regression analyses were performed to determine the risk hazards ratios (HR) of death for patients of the White, Black and other races. Among these patients, the Black patients had the worst survival outcomes in five-year OS and BCSS outcomes (HR=1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) : 1.20-1.51, P<0.01; HR=1.39, 95% CI: 1.21-1.61, P<0.01, respectively). After a 1: 1: 1 matching of the three groups, the Black patients still presented worse survival outcomes in BCSS compared to White patients (HR=1.88, 95% CI: 1.14-3.10, P=0.013), however, there was no difference in OS (HR=1.35, 95% CI: 0.93-1.96, P=0.111). Difference in outcomes may partially explained by difference in histological grades, AJCC stage, LN and PR status among the three groups. In conclusion, this study revealed that the Black patients had worse five-year OS and BCSS than White and other race patients.														1949-2553	1949-2553	10.18632/oncotarget.19396

It was found that IDC-L patients had lower tumor grade and higher hormone receptor positive proportions than IDC patients. Moreover, IDC-L patients were younger and had a similar hormone receptor status compared with ILC patients. Kaplan-Meier plots showed that the breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) of IDC-L patients was significantly better than IDC patients (P < 0.001) and tended to be better than ILC patients (P = 0.166). However, after adjusting for clinicopathological factors, survival advantage of IDC-L disappeared. Subgroup analysis indicated that IDC-L had higher hazard ratios (HRs) than IDC in grade 1, grade 2, ER-positive and ER-negative subgroups. Survival analysis in ER-positive and ER-negative subgroups showed that IDC-L predicted a worse prognosis than IDC. In conclusion, IDC-L is a distinct histological subtype compared with IDC and ILC. Lower grade and higher ER-positive proportions mainly contribute to its better prognosis. In both ER-positive and ER-negative subgroups, IDC-L predicts worse prognosis than IDC, which suggested the inadequacy of IDC-based therapy and the need of escalated therapy.														2045-2322	2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-017-10789-x

Patients and Methods: Sixty-six patients (69 breasts) with findings of American College of Radiology category 3 or 4 with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 5, 6 or 0 were included. All patients underwent digital mammography and additional DBT. Results: A total of 40/69 (58%) cancers were detected on both mammography and DBT, 23 (33.3%) were only seen on DBT (p= 0.0001); 6/69 (8.7%) carcinomas were not detected by either method, of which three were invasive lobular carcinomas. Sensitivity for multifocal/multicentric disease was significantly higher on DBT (12/19, 63.2%) compared to mammography (4/19, 21.1%) (p= 0.02), specificity was comparable (96.0% vs. 90.0%). Multifocal/multicentric disease was not detected on mammography nor DBT in 7/19 (36.8%) patients, including three invasive lobular carcinomas. Conclusion: DBT may significantly improve preoperative breast cancer staging in patients with dense breasts compared to conventional mammography alone. Nevertheless, limitations have to be expected in the case of invasive lobular carcinoma.														0250-7005	1791-7530	10.21873/anticanres.11950

The 5-and 10-year in-breast tumor reappearance IBTR) rates were 5.5% and 14.4%, respectively, for the IDC group and 7.5% and 21.8%, respectively, for the ILC group (log-rank P=.03). The excess risk of IBTR associated with ILC was particularly high for small tumors (<= 1 cm: hazard ratio [HR], 2.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.85), elderly patients (60-69 years: HR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.11-4.63; >= 70 years: HR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.08-10.0), low-grade tumors (grade 1: HR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.05-11.7), and luminal A molecular subtype (HR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.49-6.77). Among the ILC histologic variants, no difference between classic and nonclassic subgroups was observed, although the signet ring cell and solid variants had the worst local control.Conclusions: Despite a favorable tumor profile, accelerated partial breast irradiation with IORT led to a higher incidence of IBTRs in patients with ILC compared with those with IDC. Our institutional experience emphasized the importance of the size of the irradiation field, pointing to the use of larger collimators, even when dealing with small tumors, to improve local control.

National organizations have made recommendations for their use, but both physicians and their patients do not fully understand either breast cancer risk factors or risk assessment or the indications for using risk-reducing agents. Histologically predisposing conditions, such as ductal or lobular atypia and lobular carcinoma in situ, impart particularly high risks of developing subsequent invasive breast cancer. Resources should be committed to both provider and patient education to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women who are at increased risk.

Cancer Prevention Research		2017	AUG 2017	10	8	434-441	434	441							Women with atypical hyperplasia and lobular or ductal carcinoma in situ (LCIS/DCIS) are at increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer. Chemoprevention with selective estrogen receptor modulators or aromatase inhibitors can reduce breast cancer risk; however, uptake is estimated to be less than 15% in these populations. We sought to determine which factors are associated with chemoprevention uptake in a population of women with atypical hyperplasia, LCIS, and DCIS. Women diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia/LCIS/DCIS between 2007 and 2015 without a history of invasive breast cancer were identified (N = 1,719). A subset of women (n = 73) completed questionnaires on breast cancer and chemoprevention knowledge, risk perception, and behavioral intentions. Descriptive statistics were generated and univariate and multivariable log-binomial regression were used to estimate the association between sociodemographic and clinical factors and chemoprevention uptake. In our sample, 29.3% had atypical hyperplasia, 23.3% had LCIS, and 47.4% had DCIS; 29.4% used chemoprevention. Compared with women with atypical hyperplasia, LCIS [RR, 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.16-1.76] and DCIS (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.28-1.86) were significantly associated with chemoprevention uptake, as was medical oncology referral (RR, 5.79; 95% CI, 4.80-6.98). Younger women were less likely to take chemoprevention (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.87), and there was a trend toward increased uptake in Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic white women. The survey data revealed a strong interest in learning about chemoprevention, but there were misperceptions in personal breast cancer risk and side effects of chemoprevention. Improving communication about breast cancer risk and chemoprevention may allow clinicians to facilitate informed decision-making about preventative therapy.

Clinicopathological data was collected from patient files and laboratory reports. Data was analysed using SPSS v 17.Results: Of the 752 cases, 559(74.3%) were invasive ductal carcinomas of non-specific type, followed by 36(4.8%) cases of invasive lobular carcinoma. Upon investigating the clinicopathological data on the breast cancer cases, 466(61.97%) cases had sufficient information for further analysis. Of them, 414(61.97%) patients were aged above 40 years and 190(40.77%) were post-menopausal. Moreover, 221(47.42%) cases showed lymph node metastases, but only 32(6.87%) had distant metastases. The expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 was found to be positive in 343(73.6%), 299(66.7%) and 97 (24.6%) cases, respectively. Besides, 42(9.01%) cases were triple negative, which were diagnosed only in females below 40 years age.Conclusion: These results were in concordance with international reports, except for the association of triple negative breast cancer with age where it was mainly diagnosed among females younger than 40 years age.

(adri.voogd@maastrichtuniversity.nl)									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2017	JUL 2017	164	1	133-138	133	138							Background Differences in estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) expression between invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) could be an underlying reason for the difference in chemo-sensitivity and response to hormonal therapy between ILC and IDC. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in ER and PR expression levels between postmenopausal patients with hormonal receptor-positive ILC and IDC.Methods We included all ER and/or PR receptor-positive ILC and IDC, diagnosed between January 2011 and December 2013 from the population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry. A semi-quantitative classification was used to analyze differences in ER/PR expression, which consisted of three ER expression classes: 10-69, 70-89, and >= 90%. Differences in ER and PR expression levels between IDC and ILC were analyzed according to age group, tumor size, axillary nodal status, grade, and HER2 status.Results In total, 26,339 ER and/or PR-positive breast cancers were included in the study, of which 17% were ILC and 83% IDC. In patients with IDC, 86% of the tumors showed an ER expression level of 90% or more, compared to 84% in those with ILC. In both IDC and ILC a PR expression level of 90% or more was observed in 54% of the tumors. In postmenopausal patients aged 50-69 years no significant differences could be observed in ER and PR expression levels between ILC and IDC.Conclusion Patients with ER and PR-positive ILC and IDC have similar quantitative ER and PR expression profiles, implicating that ER/PR expression is unlikely to be a confounding factor in studies concerning chemo-sensitivity of ILC and IDC.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-017-4220-x

Clinico-pathological description of eight cases		Cserni, Gabor (cserni@freemail.hu) ; Floris, Giuseppe; Koufopoulos, Nektarios; Kovacs, Aniko; Nonni, Afroditi; Regitnig, Peter; Stahls, Anders; Varga, Zsuzsanna									Virchows Archiv		2017	JUL 2017	471	1	3-12	3	12							Invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast is known to produce intracellular mucin and has been recognized in single-case reports to show extracellular mucin production, as well. This latter morphology is not only rare but must also be under- or misdiagnosed. The aim was to better characterize this entity. Cases of lobular cancers demonstrating extracellular mucin formation were identified in a multi-institutional effort and their clinical and morphologic features were assessed. Immunohistochemistry was used to characterize the E-cadherin-membrane complex, neuroendocrine differentiation, and to some extent, mucin formation. All but one of the eight cases occurred in postmenopausal patients. Extracellular mucin production was present in 5 to 50% of the tumour samples and rarely also appeared in nodal and distant metastases. The tumours were completely E-cadherin negative and showed cytoplasmic p120 positivity. The majority (n = 6/8) was also completely negative for beta-catenin, but two tumours displayed focal beta-catenin positivity in the mucinous area. MUC1 and MUC2 expression was observed in all and 7/8 tumours, respectively; neuroendocrine differentiation was present in only one. Invasive lobular carcinoma with extracellular mucin formation is a rare morphologic variant of lobular carcinoma prone to be misdiagnosed and warranting further studies.

All of their prior and follow-up mammographies from a time span of 7 years (2008-2015) were considered as a reference for clinical diagnosis. After applying exclusion criteria (missing reference standard, prior procedures or therapies), patients with the first diagnosis of a malignoma or borderline lesion were selected (n = 143). Histology or clinical long-term follow-up served as reference standard. In a first step, a breast density-and age-matched control cohort was selected (n = 143) from the remaining patients with more than 2 years follow-up (n = 1003). The neural network was trained with this data set. From the publicly available Breast Cancer Digital Repository data set, patients with cancer and a matched control cohort were selected (n = 35 x 2). The performance of the trained neural network was also tested with this external data set. Three radiologists (3, 5, and 10 years of experience) evaluated the test data set. In a second step, the neural network was trained with all cases from January to September and tested with cases from October to December 2012 (screening-like cohort). The radiologists also evaluated this second test data set. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve between readers and the neural network were compared. A Bonferroni-corrected P value of less than 0.016 was considered statistically significant.Results: Mean age of patients with lesion was 59.6 years (range, 35-88 years) and in controls, 59.1 years (35-83 years). Breast density distribution (A/B/C/D) was 21/59/42/21 and 22/60/41/20, respectively. Histologic diagnoses were invasive ductal carcinoma in 90, ductal in situ carcinoma in 13, invasive lobular carcinoma in 13, mucinous carcinoma in 3, and borderline lesion in 12 patients. In the first step, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the trained neural network was 0.81 and comparable on the test cases 0.79 (P - 0.63). One of the radiologists showed almost equal performance (0.83, P - 0.17), whereas 2 were significantly better (0.91 and 0.94, P < 0.016). In the second step, performance of the neural network (0.82) was not significantly different from the human performance (0.77-0.87, P > 0.016); however, radiologists were consistently less sensitive and more specific than the neural network.Conclusions: Current state-of-the-art artificial neural networks for general image analysis are able to detect cancer in mammographies with similar accuracy to radiologists, even in a screening-like cohort with low breast cancer prevalence.

Bethune, Gillian C. (gillian.bethune@nshealth.ca) ; Pettit, Alexandra S. L.; van Zanten, Daniel Veldhuijzen; Barnes, Penelope J.									Histopathology (Oxford)		2017	MAY 2017	70	6	966-974	966	974							Aims: The 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) HER2 guidelines recommend testing all invasive breast cancers for HER2, typically with immunohistochemistry (IHC) followed by in-situ hybridization (ISH) when IHC is equivocal. As well-differentiated breast cancers are rarely HER2-positive, we assessed the value of routine reflex HER2 ISH testing for this subset of breast cancers.Methods and results: We collected HER2 IHC 2+ cases and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) data from primary breast cancers with well-differentiated tumour types (grade 1 ductal carcinomas, classic lobular carcinomas, tubular, cribriform and pure mucinous carcinomas) at our centre from 2010 to 2015. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and IHC slides were reviewed to confirm tumour type, grade and IHC score based on ASCO/CAP 2013 guidelines and their recent revisions. Of 4633 invasive carcinomas, 1133 had a well-differentiated tumour type; 177 of these were HER2 IHC equivocal, three of which were low-level amplified by FISH (0.3% of all well-differentiated tumours). One amplified case was classic invasive lobular carcinoma and two were invasive ductal carcinomas, grade 1. One amplified case had chromosome 17 monosomy, and one was rescored as HER2 IHC 1+ upon review. 'Basolateral' staining was noted in one amplified case and in 65 of 174 (37.4%) nonamplified cases. This incomplete membranous staining pattern was observed in the majority of invasive ductal carcinomas that were rescored as 1+ according to the revised 2013 guidelines.Conclusions: The rate of HER2 amplification among well-differentiated breast cancers is very low. Basolateral staining in well-differentiated tumours may be overinterpreted as HER2 IHC 2+, but is rarely associated with HER2 amplification.														0309-0167	1365-2559	10.1111/his.13160																		
J	BCI:BCI201700508411	28445295			Metastatic breast cancer to the rectum A case report with emphasis on MRI features		Lau, Li Ching; Wee, Bernard; Wang, Shi; Thian, Yee Liang (yee_liang_thian@nuhs.edu.sg)									Medicine (Hagerstown)		2017	APR 2017	96	17	Article No.: e6739	e6739								Rationale: Less than 1% of breast carcinomas metastasize to the gastrointestinal tract. The diagnosis is frequently not recognized especially when the history of breast carcinoma is remote.Patient concerns: A 61-year-old female with a remote history of breast carcinoma presented with a 3-month history of change in bowel habits. Colonoscopy showed a circumferential rectal mass with initial impression of primary rectal cancer. MRI of the rectum showed findings that are atypical for primary rectal cancer.Diagnoses: Deep biopsy of the rectal mass confirmed lobular breast carcinoma metastasis to the rectum.Intervention and outcomes: The patient was treated with radiotherapy and hormonal therapy. She is symptomatically well 2 years after presentation and remains on hormonal therapy.Lessons: Lobular breast cancer which metastasizes to the rectum can mimic primary rectal cancer clinically. The unique MRI features described in our case when present with a concordant history of lobular breast carcinoma should alert the radiologist to the possibility of this diagnosis which has important treatment implications.

(andrew.spillane@melanoma.org.au)									Breast		2017	APR 2017	32		135-143	135	143							Background: This study evaluated the impact of breast MRI on surgical planning in selected cases of breast malignancy (invasive cancer or DCIS). MRI was used when there was ambiguity on clinical and/or conventional imaging assessment.Methods: Consecutive women with breast malignancy undergoing breast MRI were included. Clinical, mammogram and ultrasound findings and surgical plan before and after MRI were recorded. MRI findings and histopathology results were documented and the impact of MRI on treatment planning was evaluated.Results: MRI was performed in 181/1416 (12.8%) cases (invasive cancer 155/1219 (12.7%), DCIS 26/197 (13.2%)). Indications for MRI were: clinically dense breast tissue difficult to assess (n = 66; 36.5%), discordant clinical/conventional imaging assessment (n = 61; 33.7%), invasive lobular carcinoma in clinically dense breast tissue (n = 22; 12.2%), palpable/mass-forming DCIS (n = 11; 6.1%); other (n = 19; 10.5%). The recall rate for assessment of additional lesions was 35% (63/181). Additional biopsy-proven malignancy was found in 11/29 (37.9%) ipsilateral breast recalls and 8/34 (23.5%) contralateral breast recalls. MRI detected contralateral malignancy (unsuspected on conventional imaging) in 5/179 (2.8%). The additional information from MRI changed management in 69/181 (38.1%), with more unilateral surgery (wider excision or mastectomy) in 53/181 (293%), change to bilateral surgery in 12/181 (6.6%), less surgery in 4/181 (2.2%). Clinical examination estimated histological size within 20 mm in 57%, conventional imaging in 55% and MRI in 71%.Conclusion: MRI was most likely to show concordance with histopathology in the 'discordant assessment' and 'invasive lobular' groups and less likely for 'challenging clinically dense breast tissue.' MRI changed management in 69/181 (38.1%). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

(Matthew.poppe@hci.utah.edu)									Breast		2017	APR 2017	32		156-161	156	161							Background: The role of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) for women with pT3NOMO breast cancer is controversial. We sought to determine the benefit of PMRT in this cohort using the National Cancer Database (NCDB).Methods: We analyzed women with pT3NOMO breast cancer who received mastectomy with or without PMRT between 2004 and 2012. We excluded men, women <= 18 years, neoadjuvant or unknown radiation or chemotherapy status, unknown estrogen or progesterone receptor status, unknown surgical margin status, histology other than invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma, and if death occurred <3 months after diagnosis. A total of 4291 patients was included for analysis. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare patient characteristics. Univariate (UVA) and multivariate (MVA) Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to identify factors associated with survival. Propensity score matching was performed to address confounding variables. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier and shared frailty models.Results: Of the 4291 women analyzed, 2030 (47%) received PMRT. On MVA, PMRT (HR 0.72, p < 0.001), chemotherapy (HR 0.51, p < 0.001), and hormone therapy (HR 0.63, p < 0.001) were associated with improved overall survival (OS). After propensity score matching, a matched cohort of 2800 women was analyzed. At 5 years, OS was 83.7% and 79.8% with and without PMRT, respectively (p < 0.001). This difference in OS benefit increased with time. At 10 years, OS was 67.4% and 59.2% with and without PMRT, respectively.Conclusions: PMRT was associated with improved OS in women with pT3NOMO breast cancer, which strongly suggests PMRT may provide a survival advantage and should be considered.

In total, 120 breast cancer patients who were hospitalized in the Departments of Breast Disease and Medical Oncology served as the subjects of this study. The subjects were diagnosed with breast cancer phase II to phase IIIA, as confirmed by aspiration biopsy and iconography. The patients were divided into two groups in a randomized control manner, with 60 patients in each group. The experimental group was administered the taxotere + epirubicin + cyclophosphamide (TEC) plan for 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy before the modified radical operation of breast cancer. In the control group, no TEC chemotherapy was carried out prior to operation. Instead, the breast lesion was removed directly by operation. After the operation, the IHC method was used to stain the ER beta protein in the lesion tissue. The patients were classified according to whether the basement membrane was broken through; 5 cases had non-infiltrative carcinoma and 115 cases had infiltrative carcinoma. According to the pathology of the lesion, 114cases had breast ductal carcinoma, 2 cases had mucinous breast carcinoma (of which there were 2 cases combined with ductal carcinoma), and 4 cases had breast lobular carcinoma. The ER beta gene was found to be expressed in normal and breast cancer tissues. When ER beta gene expression was compared before and after the chemotherapy, its expression was significantly increased in breast cancer tissues, which shows a significant statistical difference (P< 0.05). In the experimental group, the expression of ER beta gene in carcinoma tissue was significantly lower than that in the control group, and differences were statistically significant (P< 0.05). Therefore, expression of the ER beta gene in breast carcinoma tissues was high. The application of adjuvant chemotherapy before the modified radical operation for breast carcinoma can significantly lower the level of ER beta expression. The expression levels of ER beta gene in the carcinoma tissue of the patients can be treated as the evaluation index for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Regarding targeted therapy and corresponding drug development for breast carcinoma, ER beta can act as one of the specific drug targets.														1792-1074	1792-1082	10.3892/ol.2017.5659

(sambit04@gmail.com) ; Bose, Shikha; Chung, Fai; Balzer, Bonnie L.									Applied Immunohistochemistry & Molecular Morphology		2017	FEB 2017	25	2	144-149	144	149							Context: In the United States, it is estimated that 100,000 people are living with metastatic breast cancer (BC) with bone representing the most common site of involvement. However, patients with isolated bone metastasis at presentation may have a longer survival. Therapeutic options for BC bone metastases often include systemic anticancer therapy (endocrine, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, and/or other targeted therapies), which is largely dependent on the immunohistochemical (IHC) repertoire of the cancer for the prognostic markers [estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), Ki-67, p53, and Her-2/neu] at its osseous metastatic site. Traditionally, specimens obtained from the bone metastasis require decalcification, which may affect the immunoreactivity of these prognostic markers. To the best of our knowledge, limited studies describe the effect of decalcification on immunoexpression of the above-mentioned markers. A detailed illustration of the effect of decalcification on BC specimens in a real-time manner is lacking in the literature.Objective: Herein, we sought to determine the impact of decalcification on the IHC expression pattern of the above listed markers on BC tissue following decalcification.Design: After Institutional Review Board approval, sections from the residual tumor specimens were collected prospectively from 15 BC excision specimens and 1 curetting from a BC bone metastasis. The sections (3 to 6 sections/case) for decalcification were collected following routine submission for pathologic evaluation. The sections were subjected to hydrochloric acid (HCl)-based Decal Stat decalcifying solution for 2, 12, 18, and 24 hours in each case. IHC studies for ER, PR, Ki-67, p53, and Her-2/neu were performed on 1 representative section of the regularly processed tumor block and 1 decalcified tumor block from each time point. Scoring of ER and PR were performed according to the Allred scoring system. Scoring of Her-2/neu was performed according to CAP/ASCO guidelines.Results: The tumors comprised 11 grade 3 invasive ductal carcinomas, 2 grade 2 invasive ductal carcinomas, 2 grade 3 invasive lobular carcinoma, and 1 metastatic BC to bone. Nine cases showed Allred score 8 for ER, 1 case showed Allred score 4, 1 case showed Allred score 2, and the remaining 5 were ER negative. For PR, 1 showed Allred score 8, 2 Allred score 7, 4 Allred score 6, 1 each Allred score 5 and score 2 with the remainder negative for PR. Ki-67 ranged from 5% to 95%. Five cases showed p53 overexpression ranging from 35% to 95%. Five cases each showed 3+, 6 cases showed 2+ Her-2/neu, 3 cases showed 1+ Her-2/neu, and the remaining 2 were negative. All specimens demonstrated decline in ER, PR, Ki-67, and p53 immunoreactivity after 2 hours of decalcification, with additional decline up to 24 hours. The most significant declines in immunoreactivity occurred with Ki-67 and p53. Most of the Her-2/ neu cases with an equivocal score declined to zero after 24 hours of decalcification. However, 3 out of 11 cases showing Her-2/ neu overexpression remained at the baseline scoring even after extended (24 h) decalcification.Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the decalcification process affects the immunoreactivity of the prognostic BC markers. There is progressive loss of reactivity at 2 hours and beyond for markers with lower degrees of expression. In addition, heterogeneity in marker distribution progressed from diffuse to more focal beyond 1 hour.														1541-2016	1533-4058	10.1097/PAI.0000000000000277																		
J	BCI:BCI201700894547	28946562			Midkine and pleiotrophin concentrations in needle biopsies of breast and lung masses		Giamanco, Nicole M.; Jee, Youn Hee; Wellstein, Anton; Shriver, Craig D.; Summers, Thomas A.; Baron, Jeffrey (jeffrey.baron@nih.gov)									Cancer Biomarkers		2017		20	3	299-307	299	307							BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Midkine (MDK) and pleiotrophin (PTN) are two closely related heparin-binding growth factors which are overexpressed in a wide variety of human cancers. We hypothesized that the concentrations of these factors in washout of biopsy needles would be higher in breast and lung cancer than in benign lesions.METHODS: Seventy subjects underwent pre-operative core needle biopsies of 78 breast masses (16 malignancies). In 11 subjects, fine needle aspiration was performed ex vivo on 7 non-small cell lung cancers and 11 normal lung specimens within surgically excised lung tissue. The biopsy needle was washed with buffer for immunoassay.RESULTS: The MDK/DNA and the PTN/DNA ratio in most of the malignant breast masses were similar to the ratios in benign masses except one lobular carcinoma in situ (24-fold higher PTN/DNA ratio than the average benign mass). The MDK/DNA and PTN/DNA ratio were similar in most malignant and normal lung tissue except one squamous cell carcinoma (38-fold higher MDK/DNA ratio than the average of normal lung tissue).CONCLUSIONS: Both MDK and PTN are readily measurable in washout of needle biopsy samples from breast and lung masses and levels are highly elevated only in a specific subset of these malignancies.														1574-0153	1875-8592	10.3233/CBM-170145

Voprosy Onkologii (St. Petersburg)		2017		63	2	274-280	274	280							In 437 primary patients with breast cancer (BC) we compared diagnostic accuracy of mammography (MG) and mammoscintigraphy (MCG) with 99mTc-MIBI. All women, included in the study, had lesions suspicious for BC. In 108 suspicious lesions were less than 10 mm in diameter. On histology 33 (30,5%) patients had invasive BC, 20 (18,5%) - noninvasive BC, 6 (5,6%) - lobular carcinoma, 2 (1,9%) mucinous BC, 8 (7,4%) - fibroadenoma and in remained 39 cases (36,1%) localised fibrosis. In the group of women with lesions below 10 mm sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of MG in diagnosis of BC were 72%, 74%, 73%, for MCG - 62%, 51%, 57%. Combination of MG and MCG helped to increase sensitivity to 93,4%. In 53 women with dense breasts sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of MG were 40%, 71,4%, 64%; for MCG two times higher (82%) with specificity of 55% and 60% accuracy. Combination of MG and MCG allowed increasing the sensitivity of diagnosis of minimal BC 2 times more (up to 91%).														0507-3758

The incidence of SDCRF was 0.4%. Eight patients were male. The age of patients ranged from 36 years to 85 years (mean, 61 years). SDC arose from the parotid glands and submandibular gland in six and three cases, respectively. Seven cases appeared as a carcinoma component of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma cases. Six patients died of disease. Histologically, diffuse proliferations of non-coherent large ovoid or polygonal carcinoma cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei were observed in all cases; such cytological characteristics were defined as 'rhabdoid features'. Immunohistochemically, all cases were positive for cytokeratin, gross cystic disease fluid protein-15, androgen receptor, and SMARCB1, seven cases were positive for HER2, and two cases were positive for epidermal growth factor receptor. However, all cases were negative for vimentin and myoepithelial markers. Eight cases showed no or aberrant expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin. The results suggest that SDCRF is an extremely rare subtype of SDC, and not a sarcomatoid variant of SDC. SDCRF is histologically unique, and is positive for SDC markers but negative for vimentin, unlike rhabdoid-type carcinomas arising from other organs.Conclusions: The morphogenesis of SDCRF is related to no or aberrant expression of cell-cell adhesion molecules. Therefore, SDCRF could be a salivary counterpart to pleomorphic lobular breast carcinoma.														0309-0167	1365-2559	10.1111/his.12987

Mutation or deletion of the CDH1 gene has been reported in 30-60% cases of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). However, little is known about genomic differences between ILC with and without a CDH1 alteration. Therefore, we analyzed whole genome sequencing data of 169 ILC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to address this deficiency. Our study shows that CDH1 gene was altered in 59.2% (100/169) of ILC. No significant difference was identified between CDH1-altered and -unaltered ILC cases for any of the examined demographic, clinical or pathologic characteristics, including histologic grade, tumor stage, lymph node metastases, or ER/PR/HER2 states. Seven recurrent mutations (PTEN, MUC16, ERBB2, FAT4, PCDHGA2, HERC1 and FLNC) and four chromosomal changes with recurrent copy number variation (CNV) (11q13, 17q12-21, 8p11 and 8q11) were found in ILC, which correlated with a positive or negative CDH1 alteration status, respectively. The prevalence of the most common breast cancer driver abnormalities including TP53 and PIK3CA mutations and MYC and ERBB2 amplifications showed no difference between the two groups. However, CDH1-altered ILC with an ERBB2 mutation shows a significantly worse prognosis compared to its counterparts without such a mutation. Our study suggests that CDH1-altered ILC patients with ERBB2 mutations may represent an actionable group of patients who could benefit from targeted breast cancer therapy.														1949-2553	1949-2553	10.18632/oncotarget.13019																		
J	BCI:BCI201700296398				Incidence and Risk Factors for Central Venous Catheter-Related Venous Thromboembolism in Breast Cancer Patients Under Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: the Caveccas (Catheter Veineux Central et Cancer du Sein) Study		Debourdeau, Philippe; Espie, Marc; Chevret, Sylvie; Gligorov, Joseph; Elias, Antoine; Dupre, Pierre Francois; Le Long, Joel; Lavau-Denes, Sandrine; Sevestre, Marie-Antoinette; Bastit, Laurent; Kalidi, Issa; Frere, Corinne; Farge, Dominique									Blood		2016	DEC 2 2016	128	22	2607	2607								Background: Symptomatic Catheter Related Thrombosis (CRT) occurs in 3-5% of cancer patients with Central Venous Catheters (CVC) and, overall, the incidence of CRT could reach 30% when including asymptomatic cases (1). In women with Breast Cancer (BC), the most frequent cancer in females world-wide, the high risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) during chemotherapy may be related in part to CRT (2). We therefore designed the CAVECCAS (Catheter VEineux Central et CAncer du Sein) study to analyze CRT incidence and CRT risk factors in BC patients with CVC receiving (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).Methods: CAVECCAS is a prospective, multicenter cohort study of patients with non metastatic invasive BC undergoing insertion of a single lumen CVC for at least 3 months of NAC. All included patients with signed informed consent between September 2008 and December 2011 underwent repeated double-blind Doppler US evaluation before (D0) and at 7, 30 and 90 days (D) after CVC insertion. In case of VTE symptoms, diagnosis was confirmed by venography, ultrasonography and/or computed tomography. Venous blood samples were systematically drawn before and 2 days after CVC insertion to determine D-Dimers levels (VIDAS (R) D-Dimer Exclusion T (TM)), Platelet-derived MPs (Pd-MPs) and Pd-MPs expressing phosphatidyl serin (Pd-MP/PS+) levels (3), thrombin generation (Calibrated Automated Thrombogram assay (R), Stago) and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). After completing recruitment and follow-up (D90), a nested case-control study analyzed additional individual thrombophilic risk factors (Antithrombin, Protein C and Protein S levels, presence of Factor V and Factor II Leiden mutations, presence of antiphospholipid, anticardiolipin and anti beta 2GP1 antibodies) using two controls without CRT from the CAVECCAS cohort matched for TNM status with each symptomatic or asymptomatic CRT patient.Statistical analysis used Fisher or Wilcoxon tests for univariate analysis; step down selection procedure with p-values < 0.10 for multivariate models; conditional logistic model to study the occurrence of CRT based on thrombophilia testing (open-source software R Version 2.15.2 (2012-10-26).Results(expressed as median and inter-quartile range [IQR] for quantitative data and numbers and percentages for categorical data). 524 patients with non metastatic BC (85% ductal carcinoma, 12.2% Lobular carcinoma, 2.8% other) with respective T0/T1/T2/T3/T4 staging (0.5%/47.6%/43.3%/8.0%/0.7%), SBR 1/2/3 grading (11.2%/53%/35.8%), 49.2 % having node involvement and 79.5% steroid hormone receptors, were analyzed. During follow-up, the overall CRT incidence rate was 2.18 cases/100 patient-months, with 14 symptomatic and 46 asymptomatic patients, 27, 10 and 9 of the asymptomatic CRT being respectively diagnosed on D8, 30 and day 90 US. In univariate analysis, increased age (> 50 years) (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.01-3.22; p= 0.048), BMI> 30 kg/m(2) (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.46-4.76; p= 0.001) and comorbidities (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.18-3.56; p= 0.011) were associated with CRT. CRT was less frequent in ductal (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.28-1.07; p= 0.078) versus lobular carcinoma (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.32-4.85; p= 0.005). In multivariate analysis, BMI> 30 kg/m(2) (OR, 2.66: 99% CI, 1.46-4.84, p= 0.001) and lobular carcinoma histology (OR, 2.56; 95% CI,.32-4.96, p= 0.005) remained CRT risk factors. Pd-MPs (981.5 [518-2147] vs 758.5 [416.5-373] /mL; p< 0.0001) and Pd-MP/PS+(778 [409-1851] vs 730 [380.5-412]/mL; p= 0.021) levels decreased after CVC insertion versus baseline, whileConclusion: In this large sample size study with serial measurements of clinical parameters and biomarkers for thrombosis, only obesity and lobular carcinoma histology appeared strong risk factors for CRT in non metastatic BC treated with NAC. Further studies will elucidate how individual stratification of BC patients may identify those who may benefit from CRT prophylaxis.

The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is essential for the maintenance of breast CSCs. The present study used immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of Patched (PTCH) and Gli1, which are the main components of the Hh signaling pathway, as well as the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)44/CD24, which are markers for breast CSCs, in 266 patients with breast cancer. The combined expression of PTCH and Glil was significantly associated with larger tumors (>2.0 cm; P=0.001), lymph node metastasis (P=0.003), invasive lobular carcinoma (P=0.016) and Grade II-III tumors (P<0.001). In addition, PTCH and Glil expression was associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.005 and P=0.001) and Grade II-II tumors (P=0.020 and P=0.033) in breast cancer patients with the CD44(+)/CD24(-) phenotype. The expression of PTCH and Glil was also associated with significantly shorter overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) in breast cancer patients with the CD44(+)/CD24(-) phenotype. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that PTCH expression and the CD44(+)/CD24(-) phenotype were independent prognostic factors for decreased DFS in patients with breast cancer. These findings suggest that the Hh signaling pathway in breast CSCs may contribute to the poor outcome of patients with breast cancer.														1791-2997	1791-3004	10.3892/mmr.2016.5856

As such, there is currently no consensus among clinicians regarding the optimal treatment of this disease. The present study determined the risk of concomitant invasive disease and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) if PLCIS is observed on core needle biopsy (CNB) and collated the evidence regarding the risk of recurrence in relation to surgical margins and adjuvant therapy. In addition, the pertinent literature available through MedLine, PubMed, the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Gopgle Scholar using appropriate keywords was reviewed. The pooled results of studies in the literature demonstrated a concomitant presence of invasive disease of 40%, and 15% for DCIS. The studies that examined recurrence rates indicated that the risk is reduced with ample resection margins (>2 mm) and adjuvant radiotherapy. However, recent studies raise concerns regarding breast conservation when pursuing clear margins. No level 1 evidence from prospective studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or meta-analyses based on such RCTs was identified. This is a clinical issue that warrants investigation in appropriately powered well designed prospective studies for a satisfactory resolution of all concerns.

Current management options after a core needle biopsy (CNB) with lobular neoplasia (LN) incorporating both ALH and LCIS include excision biopsy or careful clinical and radiologic follow up.Methods: A retrospective analysis of the surgical database at Cork University Hospital was performed to identify all core needle biopsies from January 1st 2010 to 31st December 2013 with a diagnosis of FA who subsequently underwent surgical excision biopsy. All cases with associated LN including ALH and classical LCIS were selected. We excluded cases with coexistent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive carcinoma, LN associated with necrosis, pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (PLCIS) or lesions which would require excision in their own right (papilloma, radial scar, atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) or flat epithelial atypia (FEA)). Cases in which the radiologic targeted mass was discordant with a diagnosis of FA were also excluded.Results: 2878 consecutive CNB with a diagnosis of FA were identified. 25 cases had a diagnosis of concomitant ALH or classical LCIS. Our study cohort consisted of 21 women with a mean age 53 years (age range 41-70 years). The core biopsy diagnosis was of LCIS and FA in 16 cases and ALH and FA in 5 cases. On excision biopsy, a FA was confirmed in all 21 cases. In addition to the FA, residual LCIS was present in 14 cases with residual ALH in 2 cases. One of the twenty-one cases (4.8%) was upgraded to invasive ductal carcinoma on excision. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

(sapple@mednet.ucla.edu)									Modern Pathology		2016	DEC 2016	29	12	1471-1484	1471	1484							Optimal management of high-risk breast lesions detected by mammogram yielding atypical ductal hyperplasia, flat epithelial atypia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, and radial scar without atypia on core needle biopsy is controversial. This is a single-institution retrospective review of 5750 core needle biopsy cases seen over 14.5 years, including 249 (4.3%), 72 (1.3%), 50 (0.9%), 37 (0.6%), and 54 (0.9%) cases of atypical ductal hyperplasia, flat epithelial atypia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, and radial scar without atypia, respectively. Patient age, radiologic characteristics, needle gauge, and excision diagnoses were recorded. Of 462 high-risk cases analyzed, 333 (72%) underwent excision. Upgrade rate to ductal carcinoma in situ, pleomorphic carcinoma in situ, or invasive mammary carcinoma was 18% for atypical ductal hyperplasia, 11% for flat epithelial atypia, 9% for atypical lobular hyperplasia, 28% for lobular carcinoma in situ, and 16% for radial scar. Carcinoma diagnosed on excision was more likely to be in situ than invasive, and if invasive, more likely to be low grade than high grade. Overall, cases that were benign (vs high risk or carcinoma) on excision were less likely to have residual calcifications after biopsy (17% vs 27%, P=0.013), and more likely to have a smaller mass size (< 1 cm) (82% vs 50%, P= 0.001). On subgroup analysis, atypical ductal hyperplasia cases that were benign (vs high risk or carcinoma) on excision were more likely to have smaller mass size (< 1 cm) (P=0.025). Lobular neoplasia diagnosed incidentally (vs targeted) on core needle biopsy was less likely to upgrade on excision (5% vs 39%, P=0.002). A comprehensive literature review was performed, identifying 116 studies reporting high-risk lesion upgrade rates, and our upgrade rates were similar to those of more recent larger studies. Careful radiological-pathological correlation is needed to identify high-risk lesion subgroups that may not need excision.														0893-3952	1530-0285	10.1038/modpathol.2016.127

There are increasing concerns regarding the biological significance of LCIS. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the presence of coexisting LCIS in ILC affects tumor biology and behavior and to correlate it with other clinicopathologic parameters.Materials and Methods:In this study, 254 cases of ILC were included. Clinicopathologic parameters and immunohistochemical stains for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), E-cadherin, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), and MIB-1 of 254 ILC cases were retrieved. The patient with ILC and coexisting LCIS were compared with pure ILC cases with respect to different clinicopathologic parameters.Results:Of the 254 cases, 107 cases were pure ILC and 147 cases were ILC with coexisting LCIS. Seventy-six (76/184, 41.32%) cases showed axillary lymph node metastases. Lymph node metastasis was absent in 108 cases, micrometastasis was present in 5 cases, and stage N1, N2, N3 in 51, 5, and 15 cases, respectively. Nodal involvement, locoregional and distant recurrence of ILC with LCIS were less frequent compared with ILC without LCIS with P-value of 0.034 and 0.007, respectively. The presence of coexisting LCIS in ILC predicted higher disease-free survival (DFS) compared with pure ILC (P=0.034, log-rank test). When divided into different strata, ER-positive ILC cases with associated LCIS cases showed better DFS than ER-positive pure ILC cases (P=0.021, log-rank test). Similarly, ILC cases with LCIS in patient less than 50 years showed better DFS than the patient less than 50 years with pure ILC (P=0.045, log-rank test).Conclusions:In conclusion, ILC coexisting with lobular carcinoma in situ (ILC+LCIS) is characterized by less nodal involvement, lower locoregional, and distant recurrence and better DFS than pure ILC. When divided into different strata, ER-positive and less than 50-year groups with ILC+LCIS show even significant better DFS than pure ILC. These findings suggest that there is biological significance of coexisting LCIS in ILC and that this may have more effect on tumor aggressiveness in certain strata of ILC.														1541-2016	1533-4058	10.1097/PAI.0000000000000254

This study assessed the rate of upgrade to carcinoma at surgical excision (EXC).METHODSThis study identified women with a CNB diagnosis of intraductal papilloma without atypia or carcinoma at a cancer center between 2003 and 2013. Radiologic-pathologic concordance was assessed for all cases, and discordant cases were excluded. The radiologic and clinicopathologic features of patients with a CNB diagnosis of IDP were correlated with an upgrade to carcinoma at EXC.RESULTSThe study population consists of 189 women with 196 IDPs; 166 women (171 IDPs) underwent EXC. The upgrade rate was 2.3% (4 of 171). The upgraded lesions were 2 invasive lobular carcinomas and 2 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). One case of DCIS involved the residual IDP, whereas the other 3 carcinomas were8mm away. Twenty-four women (25 IDPs) did not undergo EXC and had stable imaging on follow-up (median, 23.5 months).CONCLUSIONSThe upgrade rate at EXC for IDPs diagnosed at CNB with radiologic-pathologic concordance was 2.3%. These findings suggest that observation is appropriate for patients with radiologic-pathologic concordant CNB yielding IDP, regardless of its size. Cancer 2016. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

(lu_na_u@rambler.ru) ; Sobchenko, S. O.; Storchai, D. M.; Chekhun, V. F.									Experimental Oncology		2016	SEP 2016	38	3	181-186	181	186							Aim: To determine the patterns of lactoferrin (LF) expression in breast cancer (BC) in relation to biologic properties of the neoplasms and clinical features of the disease course. Materials and Methods: Clinical specimens of 266 BC patients (115 patients with BC of stages I-II - retrospective study, and 151 BC patients-prospective study) were analyzed. Morphological, immunohistochemical and statistical methods were used. Results: The number of LF-positive tumors in retrospective and prospective groups was similar (52.1 and 52.8%, respectively). Among common clinical criteria for prognosis of the disease outcome in BC patients (patient's age; stage of the disease; histological type, differentiation grade, receptor status; presence of metastases), a strong correlation was found only between expression indexes of LF and estrogen receptors (ER). In ER-positive tumors expression of LF was significantly higher than in ER-negative tumors (35 vs 18%). 5-Year survival rate of BC patients was higher in LF-positive group (70 vs 52% in LF-negative group). The presence of regional metastasis tended to correlate with an increased number of LF-positive tumors. In the patients with invasive ductal carcinoma, expression level of LF moderately correlated with occurrence of luminal A subtype (r = 0.43), while in the patients with invasive lobular carcinoma this index strongly correlated with occurrence of luminal B subtype (r = 0.71). LF expression correlated positively with low and moderate differentiation grade of luminal B or basal tumors, and negatively with luminal B or basal tumors of high differentiation grade (r = -0.57 and -0.63, respectively). Conclusion: It has been shown that LF expression in breast tumors correlated with life expectancy of BC patients and important physiologic and clinical features of the disease, while the character of such relation strongly depended on molecular phenotype of tumor, i.e. luminal A, luminal B or basal.														1812-9269	1812-9269

(rossj@mail.amc.edu) ; Gay, Laurie M.; Wang, Kai; Ali, Siraj M.; Chumsri, Saranya; Elvin, Julia A.; Bose, Ron; Vergilio, Jo-Anne; Suh, James; Yelensky, Roman; Lipson, Doron; Chmielecki, Juliann; Waintraub, Stanley; Leyland-Jones, Brian; Miller, Vincent A.; Stephens, Philip J.									Cancer		2016	SEP 1 2016	122	17	2654-2662	2654	2662							BACKGROUNDActivating, nonamplification ERBB2 mutations (ERBB2mut) are not detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), but are detected by DNA sequencing and may predict clinical responses to human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-targeted therapy. The authors queried 5605 advanced/metastatic breast cancers (mBC) to uncover the frequency of ERBB2mut genomic alterations. Clinical responses to anti-HER2 therapeutics were identified.METHODSDNA was extracted from 40 mu m of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was used to evaluate up to 315 genes (592x mean coverage depth). Results were analyzed for base substitutions, short indels, copy number changes, and selected rearrangements.RESULTSOf 5605 cases, 698 (12.5%) featured ERBB2 alterations, including 596 (10.6%) ERBB2 amplifications (ERBB2amp) and 138 (2.4%) ERBB2mut; 38 cases (0.7%) had co-occurring ERBB2amp and ERBB2mut. ERBB2mut predominantly affected the kinase (124 cases; 90%) or extracellular (15 cases; 11%) domains. Both primary BC (52 cases; 38%) and metastatic site biopsies (86 cases; 62%) were found to harbor ERBB2mut, which were distributed across carcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS) (69 cases; 50%), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) (40 cases; 29%), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) (27 cases; 20%), and mucinous mBC (2 cases; 1%). Genes commonly coaltered with ERBB2 were tumor protein 53 (TP53) (49%); phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) (42%); cadherin 1, type 1 (CDH1) (37%); MYC (17%); and cyclin D1 protein (CCND1) (16%). CDH1 mutations were enriched in ERBB2mut mBC (P<0.0006) and associated with recurrent mBC. Selected patients with ERBB2mut, without ERBB2amp, who responded to anti-HER2 targeted therapies are presented herein.CONCLUSIONSWithin this large series, 1.8% of cases harbored ERBB2mut, which are undetectable by standard-of-care IHC or FISH tests. Metastatic BC driven by ERBB2mut respond to anti-HER2 targeted therapies, and expanding clinical trials designed to detect ERBB2mut by CGP and optimize targeted treatments are warranted. Cancer 2016. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society. Cancer 2016;122:2654-2662. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society. Nonamplification ERBB2 mutations cannot be detected by standard-of-care immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization, although the presence of these alterations may predict response to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeted therapy. In a series of 5605 metastatic breast cancers, 2.4% of all cases and 20% of cases with ERBB2 alterations were found to harbor nonamplification mutations, which represents a substantial patient population who may benefit from human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeted therapies.														0008-543X	1097-0142	10.1002/cncr.30102

We evaluated the proportion of HER2-positive cases (score 3 overexpression/score 2 plus fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) amplification) in a consecutive series of 2163 patients. According to immunohistochemical analysis of HER2 expression, using Herceptest and FDA criteria, 839 cases had score 0, 476 score 1+, 699 score 2+, and 149 score 3+. Of the 699 scoring 2+ cases, 160 (22.88 %) showed Her2 gene amplification by FISH analysis, making a total of 309 (14.28 %) HER2-positive cases. Grade 1 ductal and special type IBC were never HER2 positive, while only three infiltrating lobular carcinomas but a relevant percentage of small IBC were HER2 positive. Of HER2-positive cases, 52.1 % was pT1 and of these, 38.5 % was pT1b or smaller. Logistic regression analysis revealed that estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), grade, and pT were significantly associated with HER2 positivity and that HER2 3+ cases were more frequently of higher grade and pT than HER2 2+/Her2 amplified cases. In addition, HER2 3+ cases were more frequently in ER and PgR negative than HER2 2+/Her2 amplified cases. We conclude that the proportion of HER2 positive cases is lower than that reported in older literature and that pathological characteristics differ between HER2 3+ and HER2 2+/Her2 amplified cases.

Infectious Agents and Cancer		2016	JUN 30 2016	11		Article No.: 28	28								Background: Breast cancer is the commonest female malignancy globally and the second (after uterine cervix) in sub-Saharan Africa including Tanzania. Prognostic indicators reportedly influence post-mastectomy adjuvant therapy by predicting risks on survival and recurrence although in Tanzania this data is lacking. Here, we evaluate the pattern of prognostic and risk indicators among women with breast cancer undergoing modified-radical-mastectomy (MRM) at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) and Tumaini Hospital (TH), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.Methods: This hospital-based prospective cross-sectional study included female patients undergoing MRM from April 2011 to January 2012. Clinical stage I-III patients were enrolled after being scheduled for mastectomy. Patients with evidence of distant metastasis (stage IV) were excluded. Mastectomy and axillary lymph nodes biopsies were submitted to the Histopathology laboratory for grade, type, nodal and margins status. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS.Results: A total of 348 patients were admitted with breast cancer including 86 patients (with 16 from TH having similar demography and presentation) meeting inclusion criteria. Age-range at diagnosis was 28-79 years, mean 52.1 years. Most (89 %) attained menarche after 11 years. About 56 % were postmenopausal. The majority (78 %) were multiparous with positive family history in 14.1 and 37.6 % used hormonal contraceptives. About 27.1 % were social alcohol drinkers. The majority (61 %) had T4b disease, 75.6 % had positive axillary nodes including 42.7 % with 4-9 involved nodes (N2). The commonest (91.9 %) histological type was invasive ductal carcinoma. Lobular, medullary and mucinous carcinomas were rare. Most (83.7 %) of our patients presented with stage III and the rest stage II. Intermediate-and high-grade tumors accounted for 73.5 %. Following MRM, 25 % of our patients had positive surgical margins and similarly for the base.Conclusions: Most of our breast cancer patients present with frequent risks including younger age, multiparity, hormonal contraceptives use, alcohol use and family history. Unfavourable prognostic indicators including late stages, large primary tumor size, skin infiltration, positive surgical margins, positive axillary lymph nodes and a high histological grade were associated.A sustainable screening program by self-examination to allow early diagnosis is needed to reduce morbidity and mortality from this cancer.														1750-9378	1750-9378	10.1186/s13027-016-0075-8

However, discrimination between passenger and driver events in tumorigenesis remains challenging and requires in vivo validation studies in reliable animal models of human cancer. In this study, we describe a novel strategy for in vivo validation of candidate tumor suppressors implicated in invasive lobular breast carcinoma (ILC), which is hallmarked by loss of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. We describe an approach to model ILC by intraductal injection of lentiviral vectors encoding Cre recombinase, the CRISPR/Cas9 system, or both in female mice carrying conditional alleles of the Cdh1 gene, encoding for E-cadherin. Using this approach, we were able to target ILC-initiating cells and induce specific gene disruption of Pten by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic gene editing. Whereas intraductal injection of Cas9-encoding lentiviruses induced Cas9-specific immune responses and development of tumors that did not resemble ILC, lentiviral delivery of a Pten targeting single-guide RNA (sgRNA) in mice with mammary gland-specific loss of E-cadherin and expression of Cas9 efficiently induced ILC development. This versatile platform can be used for rapid in vivo testing of putative tumor suppressor genes implicated in ILC, providing new opportunities for modeling invasive lobular breast carcinoma in mice.														0890-9369	1549-5477	10.1101/gad.279190.116

Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-9 registries, we identified 10,639 patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer diagnosed from 1990 to 2011. Annual age-adjusted incidence rates and annual percent changes (APCs) were analyzed. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to investigate the impact of year of diagnosis and histology on overall survival. 9250 (86.9 %) patients had ductal and 1389 (13.1 %) had lobular carcinomas. Metastatic breast cancer incidence increased slightly over time for ductal (APC = +1.7, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = +1.0 to +2.4) and lobular carcinomas (APC = +3.0, 95 % CI = +1.8 to +4.3). Median overall survival was 22 months among the whole cohort. More recent year of diagnosis was associated with better overall survival only for patients with ductal carcinomas (interaction p value = 0.006), with an adjusted hazard ratio of death for every five-year increment in the date of diagnosis of 0.93 (95 % CI = 0.91-0.95) among ductal carcinomas, compared with 1.05 (95 % CI = 0.95-1.10) among lobular carcinomas. Overall survival was longer for lobular versus ductal carcinomas (28 versus 21 months, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio of death = 0.93, 95 % CI = 0.87-0.99), but the magnitude of this effect was attenuated among the cohort restricted to hormone receptor-positive tumors. In this population-based analysis, incidence rates of metastatic breast cancer at presentation increased slightly over time for both histologies, and particularly for lobular tumors. A modest improvement in metastatic breast cancer median overall survival was observed, but was apparently limited to ductal carcinomas.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-016-3845-5

Six months after diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer, 28.1% of patients with ILC and 39.8% of patients with IDC had received chemotherapy with a longer median time to first chemotherapy for those with ILC (P = 0.001). After six months 84.8% of patients with ILC had received endocrine therapy versus 72.5% of patients with IDC (P = 0.0001). Median overall survival was 29 months for ILC and 25 months for IDC (P = 0.53).Materials and Methods: We included 437 patients with hormone receptorpositive IDC and 131 patients with hormone receptor-positive ILC, all diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer between 2007-2009, irrespective of date of the primary diagnosis. Patient and tumor characteristics and data on treatment and outcome were collected. Survival curves were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method.Conclusions: Treatment strategies of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer were remarkably different for patients with ILC and IDC.

Kim, Elizabeth Min Hui (kimm5@sutterhealth.org) ; Hankins, Andrea; Cassity, Jamie; McDonald, Dennis; White, Barbara; Rowberry, Ron; Dutton, Sharon; Snyder, Claire									SpringerPlus		2016	MAR 31 2016	5		Article No.: 398	398								Purpose: Radial scar and radial sclerosis (RS) are considered benign breast lesions with proliferative features. There is sparse literature on frequency of cancer upgrade in these patients without atypical features found on image-guided needle biopsy. This study retrospectively reviews cases of isolated RS diagnosed on needle biopsy and evaluates the cancer upgrade after subsequent surgical excision.Methods: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of cases with an isolated RS diagnosis based on needle biopsy and subsequent surgical pathology among all patients between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013. Patients with concomitant atypia, lobular carcinoma in situ on core biopsy, complete excision of very small RS with needle biopsy, and radiology-pathology discordance were excluded. An upgrade from the needle biopsy of RS was defined as surgical excision pathology that revealed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and/or invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC).Results: 10,921 image-guided needle biopsy pathology reports were collected and 88 patients (0.81 %) were identified as having isolated RS. Of these 88 patients, 63 (72 %) underwent excision. The upgrade rate to cancer on subsequent surgical excision was 1.59 % (1/63) for DCIS; 0 % (0/63) for IDC; and 0 % (0/63) ILC. Twenty-five patients who did not undergo surgical excision had stable imaging studies with mean (+/- SD) 26 (+/- 20) months follow up.Conclusions: Isolated radial scar on needle biopsy may not warrant routine surgical excision given relatively low cancer upgrade rates. Advancement in breast imaging, pathology and multidisciplinary approaches to care may effectively guide non-surgical management of RS.														2193-1801	2193-1801	10.1186/s40064-016-1993-z																		
J	BCI:BCI201600296425	26510554			An epithelial to mesenchymal transition programme does not usually drive the phenotype of invasive lobular carcinomas		Reed, Amy E. McCart; Kutasovic, Jamie R.; Vargas, Ana C.; Jayanthan, Janani; Al-Murrani, Amel; Reid, Lynne E.; Chambers, Rachael; Da Silva, Leonard; Melville, Lewis; Evans, Elizabeth; Porter, Alan; Papadimos, David; Thompson, Erik W.; Lakhani, Sunil R.; Simpson, Peter T. (p.simpson@uq.edu.au)									Journal of Pathology		2016	MAR 2016	238	4	489-494	489	494							Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular phenotype switching phenomenon which occurs during normal development and is proposed to promote tumour cell invasive capabilities during tumour progression. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is a histological special type of breast cancer with a peculiar aetiology - the tumour cells display an invasive growth pattern, with detached, single cells or single files of cells, and a canonical feature is the loss of E-cadherin expression. These characteristics are indicative of an EMT or at the very least that they represent some plasticity between phenotypes. While some gene expression profiling data support this view, the tumour cells remain epithelial and limited immunohistochemistry data suggest that EMT markers may not feature prominently in ILC. We assessed the expression of a panel of EMT markers (fibronectin, vimentin, N-cadherin, smooth muscle actin, osteonectin, Snail, Twist) in 148 ILCs and performed a meta-analysis of publically available molecular data from 154 ILCs. Three out of 148 (2%) ILCs demonstrated an early and coordinated alteration of multiple EMT markers (down-regulation of E-cadherin, nuclear TWIST, and up-regulation of vimentin, osteonectin, and smooth muscle actin). However, the data overall do not support a role for EMT in defining the phenotypic peculiarities of the majority of ILCs. Copyright (c) 2015 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

(jgroth1@uic.edu) ; Prabhu, Sanjiv; Wiley, Elizabeth									Applied Immunohistochemistry & Molecular Morphology		2016	FEB 2016	24	2	144-148	144	148							The presence of benign epithelial inclusions in axillary lymph nodes coexistant with breast disease is a rare event; however, their presence makes the assessment of nodal disease diagnostically challenging. Broadly, these inclusions can be classified as glandular (mullerian type or nonmullerian type), mixed glandular-squamous, and squamous. Among these the presence of benign mullerian-type glandular inclusions with concurrent breast parenchymal disease is an exceedingly rare event, with 10 previous cases reported in the literature, 2 coexisting with infiltrating ductal-type mammary carcinoma in axillary lymph nodes. Here, we report the first case of coexistent invasive lobular carcinoma and endosalpingiosis in an axillary lymph node.														1541-2016	1533-4058	10.1097/PAI.0000000000000066

In this study, we investigated the follow-up excisional results for patients with RS on CNB with no history of or concurrent breast cancer or atypical proliferative lesions. The study cohort was composed of 403 such cases, and follow-up excision (PUB) was performed in 220 (54.6%). There was no significant difference in the radiologic findings in cases with and without PUB. Of the 220 cases with FUE, only 2 (0.9%) were upgraded to malignancy (1 invasive carcinoma and 1 ductal carcinoma in situ), whereas 44 cases (20.0%) were upgraded to atypical ductal hyperplasia and 13 cases (5.9%) to lobular neoplasia. Upgrades were associated with greater age but not with any other variable. This is one of the largest studies to evaluate excisional findings in patients with RS identified on CNB but no history of or concurrent breast cancer or atypical proliferative lesions, and the extremely low malignancy-upgrade rate indicates that conservative follow-up with imaging rather than surgical excisions may be more appropriate for these patients.

Poisson's regression was used to estimate incidence rates of metachronous CBC according to age, year of diagnosis, follow-up period since first breast cancer and morphology.Results Of 16,323 patients with UBC, 700 (4.3 %) developed a second malignant tumour of the opposite breast. Median age at first breast cancer was lower in the CBC group than in the full cohort. Median interval time between first and second breast cancer was 5.5 (interquartile range 2.6-10.1) years. Incidence rate at age 20-29 was 1006 (95 % confidence interval, CI, 452-2238) cases per 100,000 person-years and decreased to 299 (199-450) at 80-84. Age-adjusted incidence rates according to period of diagnosis decreased from 618 (530-721) for 1980-1984 to 329 (217-500) cases per 100,000 person-years for 2005-2006. Incidence rate ratio of CBC for lobular carcinoma was 1.28 (95 % CI 0.99-1.67) adjusted by age group and period of diagnosis compared to ductal carcinoma.Conclusions In our study, incidence rates for CBC are comparable with findings from the literature. A reduction in the incidence of metachronous CBC, thought to be due to adjuvant therapies, is seen in our data. In our cohort, younger age and lobular carcinoma were associated with an increased risk of CBC.														0171-5216	1432-1335	10.1007/s00432-015-2031-1

The main purpose of the present article is to expand on this argument from a cognitive psychology perspective and offer suggestions for further research, emphasizing how the elimination of the term "carcinoma" in "in situ" breast cancer diagnoses has the potential to reduce both patient and health care professional confusion and misperceptions that are often associated with the DCIS and LCIS diagnoses, as well as limit the adverse psychological effects of women receiving a DCIS or LCIS diagnosis. We comment on the recent peer-reviewed literature on the clinical implications and psychological consequences for breast cancer patients receiving a DCIS or LCIS diagnosis and we use a cognitive perspective to offer new insight into the benefits of embracing the new DIN and LIN terminology. Using cognitive psychology and cognitive science in general, as a foundation, further research is advocated in order to yield data in support of changing the terminology and therefore, offer a chance to significantly improve the lives and psychological sequelae of women facing such a diagnosis.

(nibrahim@mdanderson.org)									PLoS One		2016	JAN 11 2016	11	1	Article No.: e0145534	e0145534								IntroductionAlthough well recognized in breast oncology literature, histologic subtypes have not been previously described in inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). The purpose of this study was to describe lobular subtype in IBC and assess the impact of histology on patient outcomes.MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of 659 IBC patients at MD Anderson Cancer Center between January 1984 and December 2009. Patients with Invasive Lobular, Mixed Invasive Ductal and Lobular, or Invasive Ducal Carcinomas (ILC, MIC, IDC, respectively) comprise the subject of this report. Patient characteristics and survival estimates were compared by using chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank statistic. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to determine association of histology with outcomes after adjustment for other characteristics.ResultsA total of 30, 37, and 592 patients were seen to have invasive lobular, mixed, or ductal histology, respectively. Grade 3 tumors were more common in the ductal group (78%) than in the lobular (60%) or mixed (61%) group (P = 0.01). The 3-year overall survival rates were 68%, 64%, and 62% in the lobular, mixed, and ductal groups, respectively (P = 0.68). After adjustment, histology did not have a significant effect on death in the lobular group (HR = 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26-1.94; P = 0.50) or mixed group (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.25-1.13; P = 0.10) compared with the ductal group.ConclusionIn this cohort of IBC patients, lobular histology was seen in 4.5% cases. Histology does not appear to have a significant effect on survival outcomes in IBC patients, unlike in patients with non-inflammatory breast cancer (n-IBC), indicating the distinct biological behavior of the IBC phenotype.														1932-6203	1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0145534

(cjlmcatsman@gmail.com) ; Beek, Martinus A.; Rijken, Arjen M.									SpringerPlus		2016	JAN 4 2016	5		Article No.: 3	3								Background: Seroma formation, after breast surgery is a commonly seen complication with an incidence ranging from 10 to 85 %. In general, though seroma usually disappears within several weeks, some patients are troubled with chronic seroma. Seroma predisposes to infection leading to wound related complications and may also delay adjuvant chemoradiation, leading to less effective breast cancer treatment.Case description: A 52-years-old Dutch woman presenting with a pT3N1M0 infiltrating lobular breast carcinoma received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, following modified radical mastectomy with sentinel node procedure. She suffered from chronic seroma formation, delaying adjuvant radiation therapy. We successfully performed talc seromadesis to eliminate seroma formation. During six-month follow-up, no seroma was detected.Discussion and evaluation: Talc seromadesis after breast surgery is a rarely described in literature. In order to develop this technique further research aimed to evaluate its effectiveness on safety and possible later breast reconstruction must be carried out.Conclusion: Talc seromadesis may be a safe, cost effective and minimally invasive solution to treat chronic seroma after breast surgery.

European Journal of Gynaecological Oncology		2016		37	5	666-670	666	670							Introduction: Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) comprises 4-15% of all malignant neoplasms of the breast. The "classical variant of ILC" (C-ILC) constitutes some 60-80% of this cancer. The main cause of treatment failures is dissemination observed in 8-38% patients The disant metastases (DM) are frequently localized in: bones, gastrointestinal tract, uterus, leptomeninges, and ovaries. The aim of this study was to present the methods and results of the treatment of patients with DM from the classical variant of ILC (C-ILC) at a single institution in Poland. Materials and Methods: Between January 1983 and December 2004, 210 women with C-ILC of the breast were primarily treated surgically (mastectomy in 182 (86.7%) patients and breast conserving therapy in 28 (13.3%) patients). Then adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonotherapy) was applied according to presence of clinical indications. Results: The present study focused on a group of 41 patients with a median age of 59 that died with DM from C-ILC during the ten-year follow-up. This failure developed on average 65 months (3-186) after surgery of ILC. The most frequently DM developed: bones (39.1%), GI (small bowell, stomach, colon, rectum) - 31.8%, and reproductive organs (ovary, uterus) - 19.1%. In therapy of DM, different configuration surgery, radiotherapy, and chemo-hormonotherapy were used. The median survival after the diagnosis of DM was connected with localization of distant metastases. Conclusion: Patients with classic variant of infiltrate lobular cancer of breast should be regularly follow-up, which could permit early diagnosis of distant metastases and improve treatment results.														0392-2936	0392-2936	10.12892/ejgo3198.2016																		
J	BCI:BCI201600724485				Bilateral male breast cancer: a case presenting with synchronous invasive lobular carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma		Kono, Seishi (seishik@med.kobe-u.ac.jp) ; Nakai, Tokiko; Yamasaki, Takashi; Yamashita, Yuji; Tanaka, Yuko; Takao, Shintaro									International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Pathology		2016		9	3	3015-3022	3015	3022							Synchronous bilateral male breast cancer is a very rare entity and invasive lobular carcinoma is less common in male breast cancer (MBC) than in female breast cancer (FBC). A 51-year-old man presented with a palpable mass in the left breast was finally diagnosed synchronous bilateral MBC, one an invasive lobular carcinoma and the other an invasive ductal carcinoma. It remains a matter of debate whether invasive lobular carcinoma has better or worse outcome than invasive ductal carcinoma, so that clinicopathological characteristics of tumors are used to evaluate the risk of recurrence. In our case, an unusually small invasive ductal carcinoma with a low level of proliferation had already developed many axillary lymph node metastases in spite of dire clinicopathological characteristics of the invasive lobular carcinoma of the left breast determined during the first treatment, while the invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast was thought to have developed distant metastasis. We report the first case of synchronous bilateral MBC, one an invasive lobular carcinoma and the other an invasive ductal carcinoma, and discuss about the unusual clinicopathological characteristics of these two tumors.														1936-2625	1936-2625

Methods: A total of 112 Uygur and Han patients with breast invasive ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma who were diagnosed by pathology and underwent radical surgery at the Fifth Affiliated Hospital or the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University between January 2012 and January 2015 were randomly selected into the present study. Expression of Thrsp and TR beta 1 was determined using immunohistochemical staining. The correlation of the expression of Thrsp and TR beta 1 with the clinical and pathological data of the patients was analyzed using chi(2) test. The correlation between Thrsp protein expression and TR beta 1 protein expression was also investigated. Results: The positive expression rate of Thrsp in breast cancer tissues was higher than that in tumor-adjacent tissues, but the positive expression rate of TR beta 1 in breast cancer tissues was lower than that in tumor-adjacent tissues. Thrsp and TR beta 1 were mainly expressed in the nucleus, with only a little being expressed in the cytoplasm. Expression of Thrsp or TR beta 1 was correlated with different clinical and pathological data of breast cancer patients. Thrsp protein expression was related with TR beta 1 protein expression in breast cancer tissues. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that TR beta 1 and Thrsp are not independent prognostic factors for breast cancer. Thyroid hormone/TR beta 1/Thrsp may be involved in energy and substance metabolisms in breast cancer cells, and affect their mitotic process.														1940-5901																				
J	BCI:BCI201600646371				Fine needle aspiration cytology of signet ring cells in breast carcinoma: a cytohistological study of 11 cases		Ohashi, Ryuji (r-ohashi@nms.ac.jp) ; Hayama, Ayako; Matsubara, Miyuki; Watarai, Yasuhiko; Sakatani, Takashi; Takei, Hiroyuki; Naito, Zenya									International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Pathology		2016		9	6	6414-6422	6414	6422							Signet ring cell (SRC) carcinoma is a unique subtype of adenocarcinoma; however, the clinicopathological profiles of SRCs in breast carcinoma are yet to be determined. Here, we investigated cyto-histological findings of 11 breast carcinoma cases with SRCs comprising more than 20% of the tumor cells; invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) (n=4), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) (n=4), pleomorphic lobular carcinoma (PLC) (n=1), and mucinous carcinoma (MC) (n=2). The mean age of the patients was 60.2 +/- 13 years, and the mean tumor size was 2.0 +/- 0.8 cm. Three cases of IDC, 1 PLC, and 1 of MC had grade 2 or 3 nuclear atypia, whereas 1 case of IDC, 4 of ILC, and 1 of MC had grade 1 nuclear atypia. Axillary lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma in 1 patient with IDC and 1 with ILC. In fine needle aspiration smears, intracytoplasmic lumen (ICL) type SRCs were found to be major constituents of SRCs in ILC and PLC, while non-ICL type SRCs were predominant in IDC. MC tumors had SRCs of both ICL and non-ICL types. During our follow-up period ranging from 97 to 3650 (mean 1458 +/- 1055) days, all the patients were alive without recurrence of the tumor. Our results indicate that the nature of SRCs may vary with the histological subtype of breast cancer, but its presence may not indicate poor prognosis. A large study with more cases of breast cancer with SRCs for a longer period may be needed to determine the clinical significance of SRCs.														1936-2625	1936-2625																			
J	BCI:BCI201600636510	27116593			Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Mimicking Papillary Carcinoma: A Report of Three Cases		Rakha, Emad A. (emadrakha@yahoo.com) ; Abbas, Areeg; Sheeran, Rachael									Pathobiology		2016		83	5	221-227	221	227							Encapsulated and solid papillary carcinomas (EPCs and SPCs) are considered historically as a special form of ductal carcinoma in situ. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is characterised by a discohesive growth pattern. There are several variants of ILC, but, as yet, no papillary subtype has been identified. Here we report 3 cases of ILC presenting as papillary carcinoma (PC) with a typical solid papillary growth pattern. One case was reported on core biopsy as EPC (B5a). The 3 ensuing resection specimens showed features typical of SPC with a circumscribed malignant epithelial proliferation containing fibrovascular cores and surrounded, at least focally, by a thick fibrous capsule. The lobular nature of these tumours was confirmed on the resection specimens by the absence of E-cadherin and beta-catenin membrane expression. The invasive nature was confirmed by the presence of entrapped fat cells, the absence of myoepithelial cells and focal merging of the solid papillary areas with classic ILC at the periphery. Of note, 1 case was a recurrent carcinoma without an in situ component. Conclusion: This study provides further evidence that EPC and SPC represent a unique growth pattern of breast carcinomas rather than reflecting the in situ or invasive nature of the tumour, and that ILC can acquire a papillary growth pattern.

(JunZhoudoc@163.com)									European Journal of Gynaecological Oncology		2016		37	3	388-390	388	390							Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of ultrasound-guided resection of non-palpable breast masses. Materials and Methods: One hundred thirty-seven cases of non palpable breast mass patients who underwent surgical treatment from June 2007 to June 2012 were enrolled in this study. All patients were found with breast masses in mammography or ultrasound, and underwent preoperative routine ultrasound-guided wire positioning. Results: One hundred fifty-eight lesions underwent ultrasound positioning accurate resection, of which 34 cases (21.5%) were malignant, including 26 cases (16.5%) of intraductal carcinoma, four cases (2.5%) of infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and three cases (1.9%) of invasive lobular carcinoma. Thirteen patients underwent modified radical mastectomy, and 21 cases (61.8%) underwent breast conservation operation. All patients were followed up for six to 53 months, only one patient had pulmonary metastasis after two years, and there was no local recurrence. Conclusion: Resection of non-palpable breast masses with preoperative ultrasound-guided positioning has advantages of accurate positioning and simple operation and is of great significance for early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.														0392-2936	0392-2936	10.12892/ejgo2839.2016

Heather; Ahern, Thomas P.									Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention		2016	JAN 2016	25	1	201-206	201	206							Preclinical studies support an anticancer effect of statin drugs, yet epidemiologic evidence remains inconsistent regarding their role in breast cancer primary prevention. Here, we report an updated analysis of the association between statin use and breast cancer incidence in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) cohort. Postmenopausal NHS participants without a cancer history were followed from 2000 until 2012 (n = 79,518). Data on statin use were retrieved from biennial questionnaires. We fit Cox regression models to estimate associations between longitudinal statin use and breast cancer incidence. Over 823,086 person-years of follow-up, 3,055 cases of invasive breast cancer occurred. Compared with never users, both former and current statin users had similar rates of invasive breast cancer incidence [former users: HRadj, 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.82-1.1; current users: HRadj, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.92-1.3]. Associations did not differ by estrogen receptor (ER) status or histology (ductal vs. lobular carcinoma). Statin use was not associated with risk of invasive breast cancer, irrespective of histologic subtype and ER status. Statin drugs do not appear to modify processes involved in breast cancer initiation. (C) 2016 AACR.

These differences could be due to different mechanisms of carcinogenesis and tumor microenvironment, especially cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) but little has been explored in this aspect. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the status of angiogenesis, maturation of intratumoral microvessels, and proliferation of CAFs using immunohistochemistry and PCR array analysis to explore the differences of tumor microenvironment between ILC and IDC. We studied grade- and age-matched, luminal-like ILC and IDC. We immunolocalized CD34 and aSMA for an evaluation of CAFs and CD31, Vasohibin-1, a specific marker of proliferative endothelial cells and nestin, a marker of pericytes for studying the status of proliferation and maturation of intratumoral microvessel. We also performed PCR array analysis to evaluate angiogenic factors in tumor stromal components. The number of CAFs, microvessel density, and vasohibin-1/CD31 positive ratio were all significantly higher in ILC than IDC but nestin immunoreactivity in intratumoral microvessel was significantly lower in ILC. These results did indicate that proliferation of CAFs and endothelial cells was more pronounced in ILC than IDC but newly formed microvessels were less mature than those in IDC. PCR array analysis also revealed that IGF-1 expression was higher in ILC than IDC. This is the first study to demonstrate the differences of tumor microenvironment including CAFs and proliferation and maturation of intratumoral vessels between ILC and IDC.

(sschnitt@bidmc.harvard.edu)									Histopathology (Oxford)		2016	JAN 2016	68	1	57-69	57	69							E-cadherin immunohistochemistry is used commonly in surgical pathology practice to help distinguish lobular carcinoma in situ from ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive lobular carcinoma from invasive ductal carcinoma in histologically problematic or indeterminate cases. However, the interpretation of E-cadherin immunostains is not always straightforward. Failure to recognize the pitfalls and limitations of E-cadherin immunostains can lead to an erroneous diagnosis which may result in inappropriate patient management, particularly for patients with in-situ lesions. In this paper we review the uses and, particularly, the pitfalls in the interpretation of E-cadherin immunostains in distinguishing lobular from ductal lesions of the breast.														0309-0167	1365-2559	10.1111/his.12869

(lcollins@bidmc.harvard.edu)									Histopathology (Oxford)		2016	JAN 2016	68	1	138-151	138	151							Pathologists frequently encounter non-malignant histological findings in percutaneous core needle biopsies (CNBs). Standards for the management of patients with lesions such as atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, and lobular carcinoma in situ, as well as other benign lesions, are not well defined, and recommendations for surgical biopsy or continued clinical and radiological follow-up are inconsistent. The frequency with which these lesions are 'upgraded' to carcinoma in excision specimens is widely variable in the literature. Many CNB studies lack careful radiological-pathological correlation, clear criteria for excision, and clinical follow-up for patients on whom excision was not performed. This review of the recent literature emphasizes studies with radiological-pathological correlation, with the goal of developing a contemporary, evidence-based approach to the management of non-malignant lesions of the breast diagnosed on CNB. The data supporting an emerging consensus on which lesions may not require excision are highlighted. The management of non-malignant lesions diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging-guided CNB is also discussed.

As breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women, spontaneous mammary tumors in domestic animals are feasible solution for valid tumor systems model. In this study we present histological diagnosis and grading of human, canine and feline mammary tumors and evaluate their histological and biological behavior. Histological diagnosis of animal tissue samples found five cases of ductal carcinoma (n= 5, 62.5%), one lobular carcinoma, one squamous cell carcinoma and one case of metaplastic carcinoma with osteosarcomatous differentiation, graded from I to III: I (n= 1, 12.5%), II (n= 4, 50%) and III (n= 3, 37.5%). Four of the human cases were diagnosed as invasive ductal (n= 2, 40%) and lobular (n= 2, 40%) carcinoma, one case - metaplastic carcinoma, all scored as grade III.														1311-8773	2535-0811

We aimed to analyze the clinicopathological characteristics of SA and to investigate the radiological features of SA.Patients who underwent breast surgery at our institute from 2007 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 815 breasts (722 patients) were included in the final analysis. Synchronous bilateral SA was defined as the detection of another SA arising in the contralateral breast within 1 month after surgery for the initial breast lesion. Baseline characteristics, imaging records (ultrasonography, mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and pathology were included in the analysis.The median age at diagnosis was 47 years old. The majority of patients had unilateral non-Bc-SA (457/722). Among 102 patients with bilateral SA, 78.4% were diagnosed synchronously. In total, 26 patients suffered from synchronous bilateral breast cancer. Upon final pathological investigation, 226 cases were SA involving breast cancer (Bc-SA), most (56.2%) of which were ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In addition, lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and diseases that involved LCIS also comprised up to 11.1% of cases. The majority of SA cases (405; 49.7%) had no obvious symptoms except for imaging changes in mammography or ultrasound. Compared with non-Bc-SA cases, Bc-SA cases were more likely to exhibit features of mass (32.8% vs. 28.6%) and architectural distortion (20.4% vs. 13.0%) on mammography. Ultrasonography, mammography, and MRI revealed unsatisfactory sensitivity and specificity to differentiate Bc-SA from non-Bc-SA. MRI exhibited the highest sensitivity and lowest specificity, whereas the specificity of mammography was as low as 50.0%.A tendency for synchronous bilaterality in both Bc-SA and non-Bc-SA was noted. DCIS was the most commonly observed malignancy involved in Bc-SA. Although most patients with SA were asymptomatic, the ability of imaging studies to accurately differentiate non-Bc-SA from Bc-SA remained unsatisfactory.														0025-7974	1536-5964	10.1097/MD.0000000000002298

(Hannah.Gilmore@uhhospitals.org)									Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine		2015	DEC 2015	139	12	1546-1549	1546	1549							Context.-Oncotype DX (ODX) is a widely used commercial assay that estimates the risk of distant recurrence and may predict the benefit of chemotherapy in a subset of breast cancers. Some studies have shown the ability to predict Oncotype DX recurrence score (ODXRS), based on routinely reported pathologic features; however, there are limited data correlating specific histologic type of breast cancer to ODXRS.Objective.-To compare ODXRS to specific histologic types of breast cancer.Design.-One hundred eighty-four cases were sent for ODXRS testing and the results were compared with histologic type and grade.Results.-The highest average ODXRS was seen in invasive ductal carcinoma with micropapillary features (29) followed by invasive ductal carcinoma not otherwise specified (mean = 19.4, SD = 11.6), invasive mucinous carcinoma (mean = 17.2, SD = 5.9), invasive lobular carcinoma (mean = 15.7, SD = 7.2), mixed ductal and lobular carcinoma (mean = 14.1, SD = 7.7), tubular carcinoma (10.0), and mixed ductal and mucinous carcinoma (mean = 8.0, SD = 4.2). Most tumors that had a high ODXRS were grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma, representing 13 of a total of 20 cases (65%). Interestingly, 3 of the 4 cases of pure invasive mucinous carcinoma had an intermediate ODXRS.Conclusions.-Although the numbers are small, our findings raise further awareness of the significance between histologic type and grade, and RS in breast cancer. In some special histologic types of breast cancer, particularly those considered to follow either an excellent or poor clinical course by histology alone, it is unclear whether the ODXRS results are as meaningful as in carcinomas of no special type. Further investigation with higher numbers and outcome data is needed.														0003-9985	1543-2165	10.5858/arpa.2014-0557-OA

Annals of Clinical and Laboratory Science		2015	WIN 2015	45	1	10-16	10	16							Background. beta-catenin is a critical component of the cadherin cell-to-cell adhesion pathway and a key participant in the Wnt signaling pathway. Activation of beta-catenin signaling in the Wnt pathway is a known contributor to tumor cancer progression and metastasis and may result in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. The aim of this study is to evaluate the patterns of expression of beta-catenin in breast carcinoma cells before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Discovery of the molecular mechanisms responsible for resistance to chemotherapy treatment could result in more effective therapy, and improve outcome and survival. Design. Twenty-nine matched pre-treatment and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast carcinomas were subjected to immunohistochemical study using anti-beta-catenin antibody. Normal staining was defined as crisp membrane staining in >90% tumor cells; aberrant expression was nuclear staining in >5% tumor cells. Results. Of the 29 included cases, five cases of invasive lobular carcinoma lacked beta-catenin immunoreactivity pre- and post-treatment. Mildly reduced membranous staining was seen in two post-treatment samples. One case of triple-negative ductal carcinoma had reduced pre- and post-treatment staining. All other cases showed normal pre- and post-treatment beta-catenin expression. No aberrant staining was identified. Conclusion. In our study, there was no difference in the expression of beta-catenin in pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy specimens. These results do not suggest that beta-catenin plays a role in conferring neoadjuvant chemotherapy resistance.

(ulanerg@mskcc.org)									Journal of Nuclear Medicine		2015	NOV 2015	56	11	1674-1680	1674	1680							Although guidelines such as those of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network consider F-18-FDG PET/CT for systemic staging of newly diagnosed stage III breast cancer patients, factors in addition to stage may influence the utility of PET/CT. Because invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is less conspicuous than invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) on F-18-FDG PET, we hypothesized that tumor histology may be one such factor. We evaluated PET/CT systemic staging of patients newly diagnosed with ILC compared with IDC. Methods: In this Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study, our Hospital Information System was screened for ILC patients who underwent PET/CT in 2006-2013 before systemic or radiation therapy. Initial stage was determined from examination, mammography, ultrasound, MR, or surgery. PET/CT was performed to identify unsuspected distant metastases. A sequential cohort of stage III IDC patients was evaluated for comparison. Upstaging rates were compared using the Pearson chi(2) test. Results: The study criteria were fulfilled by 146 ILC patients. PET/CT revealed unsuspected distant metastases in 12(8%): 0 of 8 with initial stage 1,2 of 50 (4%) stage II, and 10 of 88 (11%) stage III. Upstaging to IV by PET/CT was confirmed by biopsy in all cases. Three of 12 upstaged patients were upstaged only by the CT component of the PET/CT, as the metastases were not F-18-FDG-avid. In the comparison stage III IDC cohort, 22% (20/89) of patients were upstaged to IV by PET/CT. All 20 demonstrated F-18-FDG-avid metastases. The relative risk of PET/CT revealing unsuspected distant metastases in stage III IDC patients was 1.98 times (95% confidence interval, 0.98-3.98) that of stage III ILC patients (P = 0.049). For F-18-FDG-avid metastases, the relative risk of PET/CT revealing unsuspected F-18-FDG-avid distant metastases in stage III IDC patients was 2.82 times (95% confidence interval, 1.26-6.34) that of stage III ILC patients (P = 0.007). Conclusion: F-18-FDG PET/CT was more likely to reveal unsuspected distant metastases in stage III IDC patients than in stage III ILC patients. In addition, some ILC patients were upstaged by non-F-18-FDG-avid lesions visible only on the CT images. Overall, the impact of PET/CT on systemic staging may be lower for ILC patients than for IDC patients.

(MMilagro.fernandez@uclm.es) ; Bueno, Gloria (Gloria.Bueno@uclm.es) ; Deniz, Oscar; Salido, Jesus; Garcia-Rojo, Marcial; Gonzalez-Lopez, Lucia									PLoS One		2015	OCT 29 2015	10	10	Article No.: e0141556	e0141556								Breast cancer diagnosis is still done by observation of biopsies under the microscope. The development of automated methods for breast TMA classification would reduce diagnostic time. This paper is a step towards the solution for this problem and shows a complete study of breast TMA classification based on colour models and texture descriptors. The TMA images were divided into four classes: i) benign stromal tissue with cellularity, ii) adipose tissue, iii) benign and benign anomalous structures, and iv) ductal and lobular carcinomas. A relevant set of features was obtained on eight different colour models from first and second order Haralick statistical descriptors obtained from the intensity image, Fourier, Wavelets, Multiresolution Gabor, M-LBP and textons descriptors. Furthermore, four types of classification experiments were performed using six different classifiers: (1) classification per colour model individually, (2) classification by combination of colour models, (3) classification by combination of colour models and descriptors, and (4) classification by combination of colour models and descriptors with a previous feature set reduction. The best result shows an average of 99.05% accuracy and 98.34% positive predictive value. These results have been obtained by means of a bagging tree classifier with combination of six colour models and the use of 1719 non-correlated (correlation threshold of 97%) textural features based on Statistical, M-LBP, Gabor and Spatial textons descriptors.

Although malignant transformation in FA is rare, there is evidence of an association with breast carcinoma, particularly in middle-aged females with associated risk factors, such as a strong family history and/or BRCA-1/2 mutations. The current study presents the case of a 44-year-old female exhibiting lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) arising within an FA. Over the previous 20 years, numerous lumps were detected in the patient's breasts, all of which were clinically diagnosed as FA and expectantly managed. One year prior to presentation, the patient's father was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, older sister with kidney cancer and the patient herself with a benign ovarian teratoma. The patient presented with one lump in each breast and monitoring was performed using ultrasonography (US). US detected an increase in the size of the two lumps and analysis of the images was used to propose a diagnosis of FA. Therefore, a lumpectomy was performed. Analysis of the frozen section indicated a diagnosis of FA in the right breast, however, a 5-mm LCIS was identified within the FA of the left breast. Subsequent to the identification of three additional lumps in the left breast, a left mastectomy was performed. During a five-year follow-up period, no local recurrence or contralateral breast carcinoma occurred. The present study showed that FAs containing foci of carcinoma in situ can he indistinguishable from benign lesions following imaging, therefore, despite the incidence of carcinoma within FA is estimated at 0.1-0.3%, it should be considered a long-term risk factor for invasive breast cancer. The present describes a case of LCIS arising within an FA and conducts a review of the relevant literature.														1792-1074	1792-1082	10.3892/ol.2015.3488

The present study reported the cases of 11 patients with accessory breast cancer. The patients with accessory breast cancer were admitted between January 2002 and June 2014, and the patient records were retrospectively analysed. All patients presented with a tumour that was localised in the axilla. Out of these patients, there were 8 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma and 3 patients with invasive lobular carcinoma. The follow-up periods for patients ranged between 4 and 54 months. Out of the 5 patients that experienced neoplasm metastases, 4 patients succumbed to the disease. In total, 6 patients remain alive with no evidence of disease. Accessory breast cancer is a progressive tumour, and long-term follow-up is required. A comprehensive treatment strategy may be an effective treatment option for patients; however, the optimal time at which to commence chemotherapy and the role of combined radiotherapy and endocrine therapy require additional investigation.														1792-1074	1792-1082	10.3892/ol.2015.3388

We hypothesized that most contralateral breast cancers (CBCs) develop >= 5 years after the primary breast cancer (PBC) and that CBCs have more favorable tumor characteristics.Methods. This is a single-institution retrospective review of 323 patients who were diagnosed with CBC from 1990 to 2014. CBCs were diagnosed at least I year after the diagnosis of PBC. X-2 tests and one-way analysis of variance were used to examine the time interval and pathologic features between the PBC and CBC.Results. The median time interval between the PBC and CBC was 6.2 years (average: 7.1, range: 1.01-23.0), and 189 (58.5%) patients had a time interval >= 5 years. Patients >= 70 years old developed a CBC sooner than patients <50 years (median: 4.3 vs 6.6 years, P < .001). Patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma developed their CBC in 9.0 years versus 6.2 years for infiltrating ductal carcinoma histology (P = .028). In comparison with the PBC, a greater proportion of CBCs were stage I (50.8%), T1 (72.1%), node negative (67.5%), and estrogen receptor positive (68.7%). Of the 252 patients with available tumor size information for both cancers, only 54 (21.4%) patients developed a CBC that was >1 cm larger than their PBC, and only 25 (9.9%) patients developed a CBC that was >2 cm larger than their PBC. Only 28 of 201 (13.9%) node-negative PBCs developed a node-positive CBC.Conclusion. A majority of CBCs develop >= 5 years after the diagnosis of the PBC CBCs have more favorable tumor characteristics than the PBC and tend to be smaller and node negative.

J	BCI:BCI201500651543	26270346			The Expression of the Zonula Adhaerens Protein PLEKHA7 Is Strongly Decreased in High Grade Ductal and Lobular Breast Carcinomas		Tille, Jean-Christophe; Ho, Liza; Shah, Jimit; Seyde, Olivia; McKee, Thomas A.; Citi, Sandra (sandra.citi@unige.ch)									PLoS One		2015	AUG 13 2015	10	8	Article No.: e0135442	e0135442								PLEKHA7 is a junctional protein, which participates in a complex that stabilizes E-cadherin at the zonula adhaerens. Since E-cadherin is involved in epithelial morphogenesis, signaling, and tumor progression, we explored PLEKHA7 expression in cancer. PLEKHA7 expression was assessed in invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas of the breast by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR. PLEKHA7 was detected at epithelial junctions of normal mammary ducts and lobules, and of tubular and micropapillary structures within G1 and G2 ductal carcinomas. At these junctions, the localization of PLEKHA7 was along the circumferential belt (zonula adhaerens), and only partially overlapping with that of E-cadherin, p120ctn and ZO-1, as shown previously in rodent tissues. PLEKHA7 immunolabeling was strongly decreased in G3 ductal carcinomas and undetectable in lobular carcinomas. PLEKHA7 mRNA was detected in both ductal and lobular carcinomas, with no observed correlation between mRNA levels and tumor type or grade. In summary, PLEKHA7 is a junctional marker of epithelial cells within tubular structures both in normal breast tissue and ductal carcinomas, and since PLEKHA7 protein but not mRNA expression is strongly decreased or lost in high grade ductal carcinomas and in lobular carcinomas, loss of PLEKHA7 is a newly characterized feature of these carcinomas.														1932-6203	1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0135442

The present study was conducted to examine the interrelationships of these predictive and prognostic factors as well as their effects on breast carcinoma subtypes.The archives of all patients with breast carcinoma (from 2008 to 2014) were studied. Patients' data were extracted using a checklist that included age, histology type, size and grade of tumor, lymph node involvement, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status, along with the overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2/neu) and the rate of Ki67 and p53 mutations. All data were analyzed by SPSS-17 software with (2) and Fisher exact tests, as well as the least significant difference pairwise comparison test.A total of 566 patients' records were included in this study. The mean age of patients was 5012.9 with an age range of 17 to 98 years. A meaningful correlation was found between age and the type of tumor (P=0.001). Infiltrating lobular carcinoma had a higher ER positivity between groups (85.7%), whereas noninvasive carcinomas had a higher PR positivity (67%). In addition, a meaningful correlation was detected between the type and grade of tumor (P=0.001). No meaningful relationship was observed between the type of tumor and HER2/neu overexpression and number of lymph nodes involved. Between the groups, medullary carcinoma had the highest Ki67 index (P=0.007). Meaningful correlation was found between the grade of tumor and lymph node involvement (P=0.005) and also with HER2/neu overexpression (P=0.002). Higher grades had greater positivity in Ki67 index and p53 mutation rates (P=0.002, P=0.01). HER2/neu positive tumors had a higher Ki67 index (P=0.03).Higher Ki67 index tumors showed more HER2/neu overexpression, larger size, and more lymph node involvement compared with other types and maybe considered aggressive. Moreover, in young patients with breast carcinoma, the rates of Ki67 with the overexpression of HER2/neu and p53 mutations are higher, and it shows a more aggressive behavior than other tumors assessed in this age group.

In addition, the prognostic effect of molecular subtypes on ILC remains unclear. In this study, the clinicopathological and prognostic data between 269 ILC and 816 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) cases in a Chinese population were extensively compared, with a median follow-up time of 7.8 years. Compared with the IDC group, ILC tumors had more lymph node invasion, hormonal receptor positivity, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negativity. ILC patients showed overall survival (OS) and recurrence/metastasis-free survival (RFS) rates similar to those of IDC patients but exhibited worse disease-free survival (DFS) rate because of the higher rate of contralateral breast cancer (BC). Further analysis showed that OS, RFS, and DFS were similar between ILC and IDC patients in the subgroups of luminal A and triple-negative BC with HER2 negativity but were worse in ILC patients than those in IDC patients in the subgroups of luminal B and HER2 overexpression with positive HER2 expression. Multivariate analysis indicated HER2 positivity as an independent risk factor for OS, RFS, and DFS of ILC patients, which increased the risk in the ILC group than that in IDC group. The interaction of HER2 and ILC was also defined as an independent risk factor for OS, RFS, and DFS of the entire population. In conclusion, overexpression of HER2 exhibited stronger negative effect on the prognosis of ILC patients than that in IDC patients, suggesting that treatment targeting HER2 is crucial for this BC subgroup.														1010-4283	1423-0380	10.1007/s13277-015-3293-6

The screening programs and advances in the treatment of patients with breast cancer have led to an increase in overall survival. Cancer registry systems play an important role in providing basic data for research and the monitoring of the cancer status. In this study, the results of the 10-year national cancer registry (NCR) of Iran in breast cancer are reviewed. NCR database records were searched for primary breast cancer records according to ICD-O-3 coding and the cases were reviewed. A total of 52,068 cases were found with the coding of primary breast cancer. Females constituted 97.1% of the cases. Breast cancer was the leading type of cancer in Iranian females, accounting for 24.6% of all cancers. The mean age of the women with breast cancer was 49.6 years (95% CI 49.5-49.6). Most of the cases (95.7%) were registered as having invasive pathologies (behavior code 3). The most common morphology of primary breast cancer was invasive ductal carcinoma (ICD-O 8500/3) followed by invasive lobular carcinoma (ICD-O 8520/3) with relative frequencies of 77.8% and 5.2%, respectively. The average annual crude incidence of primary breast cancer in females was 22.6 (95% CI 22.1-23.1) per 100,000 females, with an age-standardized rate (ASR) of 27.4 (95% CI 22.5-35.9). There were no data on survival, staging or immunohistochemical marker(s) of the breast-cancer-registered cases. The incidence of breast cancer in Iran is lower than in low-middle-income neighboring countries. The NCR data registry of breast cancer is not accurate in monitoring the effect of screening programs or determining the current status of breast cancer in Iran. Screening programs of breast cancer in Iran have failed to enhance the detection of the patients with in situ lesion detection. A quality breast cancer registry and a screening program for breast cancer are both needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

After 2002, the HT use has dropped substantially; however, the breast cancer incidence has declined only marginally. How much mammography screening contributed to the breast cancer incidence increase in the 1990s compared with HT use and specifically different types of HT use, has thus been discussed. Whether HT affects the incidence of subtypes of breast cancer differently has also been questioned. We have linked individual data from several national registries from 2004 to 2009 on 449,717 women aged 50-65 years. 4597 cases of invasive cancer and 681 cases of ductal carcinoma insitu (DCIS) were included in the analysis. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratio (HR) as a measure of the relative risk of breast cancer associated with use of HT. The HRs associated with prescriptions of HT for more than 1 year were 2.06 (1.90-2.24) for estrogen and progesterone combinations, 1.03 (0.85-1.25) for systemic estrogens, and 1.23 (1.01-1.51) for tibolone. Invasive lobular carcinoma was more strongly associated with use of estrogen and progesterone combinations, HR = 3.10 (2.51-3.81), than nonlobular carcinoma, HR = 1.94 (1.78-2.12). The corresponding value for DCIS was 1.61 (1.28-2.02). We estimated the population attributable fraction to 8.2%, corresponding to 90 breast cancer cases in 2006 indicating that HT use still caused a major number of breast cancer cases.														2045-7634	2045-7634	10.1002/cam4.474

Dysfunctional telomeres contribute to genomic instability, promote tumorigenesis, and, in breast cancer, have been associated with increased cancer risk and poor prognosis. Short telomere lengths have been previously associated with triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor (Her2)-positive ductal carcinomas. However, these investigations have not specifically assessed invasive lobular carcinomas (ILCs), which accounts for 5% to 15% of all invasive breast cancers. Here, we evaluate telomere lengths within 48 primary ILCs with complete characterization of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and Her2 status, including 32 luminal/Her2- (ER+/PR+/Her2), 8 luminal/Her2+ (ER+/PR+/Her2+), 3 Her2+ (ER-/PR-/Her2+), and 5 triple-negative (ER-/PR-/Her2) carcinomas. A telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, which provides single-cell telomere length resolution, was used to evaluate telomere lengths and compare with standard clinicopathological markers. In contrast to breast ductal carcinoma, in which more than 85% of cases display abnormally short telomeres, approximately half (52%) of the ILCs displayed either normal or long telomeres. Short telomere length was associated with older patient age. Interestingly, 3 cases (6%) displayed a unique telomere pattern consisting of 1 or 2 bright telomere spots among the normal telomere signals within each individual cancer cell, a phenotype that has not been previously described. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate the significance of the unique bright telomere spot phenotype and the potential utility of telomere length as a prognostic marker in lLC.

J	BCI:BCI201500465789	25687106			Digital mammography screening in Germany: Impact of age and histological subtype on program sensitivity		Heidinger, Oliver (Oliver.Heidinger@krebsregister.nrw.de) ; Heidrich, Jan; Batzler, Wolf Ulrich; Krieg, Volker; Weigel, Stefanie; Heindel, Walter; Hense, Hans-Werner									Breast		2015	JUN 2015	24	3	191-196	191	196							Introduction: Program sensitivity (PS), i.e., the ratio of screen-detected cancers divided by the sum of screen-detected plus interval cancers, is a major outcome in population-based mammography screening programs (MSP). This study evaluated PS within the digital MSP in Germany focussing on the impact of age and histological subtype.Methods: Data of 838,579 first-time participants aged 50-69 years who were screened in 2005-2008 were linked with cancer registry data from Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia. Invasive breast cancers and ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) were detected either at screening or during the 24 month post-screening interval. PS was evaluated with respect to age at screening, in-situ or invasive cancer and histological characteristics.Results: In total, 6767 cancers were detected at screening and 1884 cancers were diagnosed during the post-screening interval. The overall PS amounted to 78.2% and increased from 72.1% at age 50-54 years to 82.4% at age 65-69 years (p for trend <0.0001). PS was higher for non-lobular (79.1%) than lobular carcinomas (72.1%, p < 0.0001). The highest PS was observed in DCIS across all ages (> 90%), while PS was lowest among participants aged 50-54 years with invasive breast cancer (67.7%), particularly among those with lobular subtype (62.8%). Interval cancers showed generally more advanced tumour stages.Conclusions: While overall PS was high, differences across subgroups indicated that youngest screening participants are at higher risk of interval cancer. Age-adapted recall and assessment strategies in younger participants may need to be considered to improve PS in younger women. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Breast		2015	JUN 2015	24	3	272-277	272	277							Women who have undergone surgical treatment for breast cancer often benefit from a contralateral reduction mammaplasty (CRM) aimed at symmetrization of the contralateral breast unaffected by the initial cancer. In our 7-year multicentric study (12 centers) of 2718 patients, incidence of CRM cancers (CRMc) was 1.47% (n = 40) [95% CI 1.05%-2.00%]. The CRMc group had significantly more initial mammary cancers of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC, 22.5% vs 12.0%) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, 35.0% vs 21.6%) types than the healthy CRM group (p = 0.017). 35.0% (n = 14) of patients had en bloc resection; 25.0% (n = 10) of surgical specimens were correctly oriented. En bloc resection and orientation of surgical specimens enable precise pinpointing of the CRMc. A salvage lumpectomy may be proposed as an option when margins are invaded. The histological distribution of the 40 CRMc (mean size 12.7 mm) was carcinoma in situ (CIS) 70%, ILC 12.5%, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) 12.5% and tubular carcinoma (TC) 5.0%.

(MMilagro.fernandez@uclm.es) ; Bueno, Gloria (Gloria.Bueno@uclm.es) ; Deniz, Oscar; Salido, Jesus; Garcia-Rojo, Marcial; Gonzandez-Lopez, Lucia									Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics		2015	JUN 2015	42	Sp. Iss. SI	25-37	25	37							Advances in digital pathology are generating huge volumes of whole slide (WSI) and tissue microarray images (TMA) which are providing new insights into the causes of cancer. The challenge is to extract and process effectively all the information in order to characterize all the heterogeneous tissue-derived data. This study aims to identify an optimal set of features that best separates different classes in breast TMA. These classes are: stroma, adipose tissue, benign and benign anomalous structures and ductal and lobular carcinomas. To this end, we propose an exhaustive assessment on the utility of textons and colour for automatic classification of breast TMA. Frequential and spatial texton maps from eight different colour models were extracted and compared. Then, in a novel way, the TMA is characterized by the 1st and 2nd order Haralick statistical descriptors obtained from the texton maps with a total of 241 x 8 features for each original RGB image. Subsequently, a feature selection process is performed to remove redundant information and therefore to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector. Three methods were evaluated: linear discriminant analysis, correlation and sequential forward search. Finally, an extended bank of classifiers composed of six techniques was compared, but only three of them could significantly improve accuracy rates: Fisher, Bagging Trees and AdaBoost Our results reveal that the combination of different colour models applied to spatial texton maps provides the most efficient representation of the breast TMA. Specifically, we found that the best colour model combination is Hb, Luv and SCT for all classifiers and the classifier that performs best for all colour model combinations is the AdaBoost. On a database comprising 628 TMA images, classification yields an accuracy of 98.1% and a precision of 96.2% with a total of 316 features on spatial textons maps. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and Methods: Tissue microarrays were constructed, containing 30 samples from normal breast tissue, 114 samples from patients with ILC, and 692 samples from patients with IDC. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to examine the expression of sarcosine metabolism-related proteins [glycine N-methyltransferase, sarcosine dehydrogenase, and l-pipecolic acid oxidese (PIPOX)]. Results: The sarcosine metabolic phenotype differed between ILC and DC (p<0.001). In IDC, sarcosine metabolic phenotype was distributed as null type (61.7%)>low sarcosine type (30.4%)>high sarcosine type (5.0%)>intermediate type (2.9%). However, in ILC, the sarcosine metabolic phenotype was distributed as low sarcosine type (61.4%)>null type (32.5%)>intermediate type (5.3%)>high sarcosine type (0.9%). PIPOX showed higher expression in ILC than in IDC (p<0.001) and correlated with androgen receptor (AR) positivity (p=0.001) in ILC. Conclusion: Expression of sarcosine metabolism-related proteins differed between ILC and IDC. Low sarcosine type was the majority sarcosine metabolic phenotype of ILC. PIPOX expression was predominant in ILC and correlated with AR positivity.														0513-5796	1976-2437	10.3349/ymj.2015.56.3.598

In this study, sortilin was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a series of 318 clinically annotated breast cancers and 53 normal breast tissues. Sortilin was detected in epithelial cells, with increased levels in cancers, as compared to normal tissues (p = 0.0088). It was found in 79% of invasive ductal carcinomas and 54% of invasive lobular carcinomas (p < 0.0001). There was an association between sortilin expression and lymph node involvement (p = 0.0093), suggesting a relationship with metastatic potential. In cell culture, sortilin levels were higher in cancer cell lines compared to non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells and siRNA knockdown of sortilin inhibited cancer cell adhesion, while proliferation and apoptosis were not affected. Breast cancer cell migration and invasion were also inhibited by sortilin knockdown, with a decrease in focal adhesion kinase and SRC phosphorylation. In conclusion, sortilin participates in breast tumor aggressiveness and may constitute a new therapeutic target against tumor cell invasion.

Synchronicity/metachronicity are usually associated with local and lymphatic spread and with blood-borne spread to lungs, bones and liver. Moreover BBC are mostly lobular carcinomas but we report a rare case of Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) as the primary carcinoma and Lobular Carcinoma as the secondary.Case description: 56 year old female who presented with a Stage IIIB fungating growth around 10x8cm in the lower inner, lower outer and upper outer quadrant of right breast since 6 months and a StageIIA 4x4cm tumour felt in the left breast in the upper inner and lower outer quadrant. Wedge biopsy of the right breast fungating mass showed Ductal Carcinoma and FNAC of the left breast lump suggested Lobular carcinoma which was confirmed on Histopathology after surgery. Patient was subjected to Hormonal therapy (Tab Tamoxifen), chemotherapy (Cyclophosphamide, 5 FU, and Doxorubicin) followed by Radiotherapy. Patient recovered well and shows no recurrence or signs of metastasis in the 8 months of follow up.Discussion and evaluation: Different histological subtypes with different grades of tumour in both breasts suggested two different synchronous primary tumours. Early detection of the contralateral tumour is of utmost importance emphasising the significance of breast self-examination. Screening tools like MRI have a greater sensitivity compared to Mammography. There are no clear treatment guidelines for bilateral breast cancer. Patients are often treated with bilateral mastectomy, with breast conservative surgery having unclear importance.Conclusion: Meticulous diagnosis and appropriate management help to improve the longitivity with an improved quality of life.														2193-1801	2193-1801	10.1186/s40064-015-0953-3

Of these patients, 218 (1.5%) suffered from synchronous bilateral breast cancer (sBBC), and 296 (2.0%) suffered from metachronous bilateral breast cancer (mBBC). Patients with a lobular carcinoma component, those with estrogen receptor-positive cancer, and those with an accompanying sclerosing adenosis in the affected breast tended to develop BBC. The rates of bilateral mastectomy, breast conserving therapy, reconstruction, and combined surgeries were 86.2%, 6.4%, 3.7%, and 3.7%, respectively, for patients with sBBC and 81.1%, 4.4%, 3.0%, and 11.5%, respectively, for patients with mBBC. The interval between bilateral cancers, age at first diagnosis of breast cancer, histopathological type, and stage have significant impacts on the choice of surgery for patients with BBC.ConclusionsBilateral mastectomy was the dominant surgical management for patients with BBC in China, despite the increased application of breast reconstruction surgery observed in recent years. Bilateral prosthetic breast reconstruction was the ideal choice for patients with sBBC. Chinese surgeons should take responsibility for patient education and inform their patients about their surgical options.

It consists of several histological subtypes that can be separated by morphology and immunohistochemistry. The aim of our study was to determine the distribution of breast cancer histological and molecular subtypes, and their relationship with clinical and pathological characteristics. A total of 561 patients who underwent breast carcinoma surgical treatment from January 2003 till December 2012 were enrolled in the study. In total, invasive ductal carcinomas not otherwise specified (IDC-NOS) plus invasive ductal carcinomas no special type (IDC-NST) were observed in 430 patients (76.65% of cases), medullar carcinoma in 14 patients (2.45%), other rare ductal carcinoma subtypes in 13 patients (2.31%), lobular carcinoma in 81 patients (14.4%) and tubulolobular carcinoma in 23 patients (4.19%). Ductal carcinoma, lobular and tubulolobular carcinoma had predominantly luminal A and B subtype, whereas medullar carcinoma had HER2- positive and triple-negative (TN) subtype. Tubular, cribriform, mucinous, papillary, and apocrine carcinomas had predominantly luminal A subtype. Significant differences between breast cancer histological subtypes and clinicopathological characteristics were observed.

(J.T.Buijs@LUMC.nl) ; Matula, Kasia M.; Cheung, Henry; Kruithof-de Julio, Marianna; van der Mark, Maaike H.; Snoeks, Thomas J.; Cohen, Ron; Corver, Willem E.; Mohammad, Khalid S.; Jonkers, Jos; Guise, Theresa A.; van der Pluijm, Gabri									Journal of Pathology		2015	APR 2015	235	5	745-759	745	759							Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) are the most frequently occurring histological subtypes of breast cancer, accounting for 80-90% and 10-15% of the total cases, respectively. At the time of diagnosis and surgical resection of the primary tumour, most patients do not have clinical signs of metastases, but bone micrometastases may already be present. Our aim was to develop a novel preclinical ILC model of spontaneous bone micrometastasis. We used murine invasive lobular breast carcinoma cells (KEP) that were generated by targeted deletion of E-cadherin and p53 in a conditional K14cre;Cdh1((F/F));Trp53((F/F)) mouse model of de novo mammary tumour formation. After surgical resection of the growing orthotopically implanted KEP cells, distant metastases were formed. In contrast to other orthotopic breast cancer models, KEP cells readily formed skeletal metastases with minimal lung involvement. Continuous treatment with SD-208 (60mg/kg per day), an orally available TGF receptor I kinase inhibitor, increased the tumour growth at the primary site and increased the number of distant metastases. Furthermore, when SD-208 treatment was started after surgical resection of the orthotopic tumour, increased bone colonisation was also observed (versus vehicle). Both our in vitro and in vivo data show that SD-208 treatment reduced TGF signalling, inhibited apoptosis, and increased proliferation. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that orthotopic implantation of murine ILC cells represent a new breast cancer model of minimal residual disease in vivo, which comprises key steps of the metastatic cascade. The cancer cells are sensitive to the anti-tumour effects of TGF. Our in vivo model is ideally suited for functional studies and evaluation of new pharmacological intervention strategies that may target one or more steps along the metastatic cascade of events.

Here, we show that Dlx-2, one of distal-less (Dlx) homeobox genes, induces EMT and glycolytic switch by activation of Snail. In addition, it was induced by TGF-beta and Wnt and regulates TGF-beta- and Wnt-induced EMT and glycolytic switch by activating Snail. We also found that TGF-beta/Wnt suppressed cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, in a Dlx-2/Snail-dependent manner. TGF-beta/Wnt appeared to downregulate the expression of various COX subunits including COXVIc, COXVIIa and COXVIIc; among these COX subunits, COXVIc was a common target of TGF-beta, Wnt, Dlx-2 and Snail, indicating that COXVIc downregulation plays an important role(s) in TGF-beta/Wnt-induced COX inhibition. Taken together, our results showed that Dlx-2 is involved in TGF-beta- and Wnt-induced EMT, glycolytic switch, and mitochondrial repression by Snail activation.														1019-6439	1791-2423	10.3892/ijo.2015.2874

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2015	FEB 2015	150	1	191-198	191	198							Identification of patients who are at increased risk for contralateral breast cancer is essential to determine which patients should be routinely screened for contralateral breast cancer using MRI. The aim of this study was to assess the association of age and tumor morphology with contralateral breast cancer incidence in a large, nationwide population-based study in the Netherlands. All patients with breast cancer stage I-III, diagnosed between 1989 and 2009, were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. The association between contralateral breast cancer risk with tumor morphology and age was assessed using competing-risk regression according to Fine & Gray. Overall, 194,898 patients were included. In multivariable analyses, lobular tumors were significantly associated with an increased risk of contralateral breast cancer within 6 months (cumulative incidence 1.9 %, subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 1.17, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.30 compared with 1.3 % in ductal tumors, p = 0.002). Age was also associated with an increased risk of contralateral breast cancer within 6 months (SHR 2.34, 95 % CI 2.08-2.62, p < 0.002 for patients over the age of 75 as compared to patients younger than 50 years). The absolute risk of contralateral breast cancer within 6 months is only slightly increased in patients with a lobular tumor and older patients. In our view, this small increased risk does not justify standard use of preoperative MRI based on tumor morphology or age alone. We propose a more personalized strategy in which additional risk factors (family history, prognosis of primary tumor, and others) may play a role.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-015-3294-6

(rroetzhe@health.usf.edu) ; Lee, Ji-Hyun; Fulp, William; Gomez, Elizabeth Matos; Clayton, Elissa; Tollin, Sharon; Khakpour, Nazanin; Laronga, Christine; Lee, Marie Catherine; Kiluk, John V.									Breast		2015	FEB 2015	24	1	51-56	51	56							Background: Chemoprevention is an option for women who are at increased risk of breast cancer (five year risk >= 1.7%). It is uncertain, however, how often women accept and complete five years of therapy and whether clinical or demographic factors predict completion.Methods: Medical records were abstracted for 219 women whose five year risk of breast cancer was >= 1.7% and who were offered chemoprevention while attending a high risk breast clinic at the Moffitt Cancer Center. We examined the likelihood of accepting chemoprevention and completing five years of therapy, and potential clinical and demographic predictors of these outcomes, using multivariable logistic regression and survival analysis models.Results: There were 118/219 women (54.4%) who accepted a recommendation for chemoprevention and began therapy. The likelihood of accepting chemoprevention was associated with lifetime breast cancer risk and was higher for women with specific high risk conditions (lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical ductal hyperplasia). Women with osteoporosis and those that consumed alcohol were also more likely to accept medication. There were 58/118 (49.2%) women who stopped medication at least temporarily after starting therapy. Based on survival curves, an estimated 60% of women who begin chemoprevention will complete five years of therapy.Conclusions: A substantial percentage of women at increased risk of breast cancer will decline chemoprevention and among those that accept therapy, approximately 40% will not be able to complete five years of therapy because of side effects.

J	BCI:BCI201500102118	25277350			Screening breast magnetic resonance imaging in women with atypia or lobular carcinoma in situ		Schwartz, Theresa (schwartl@slu.edu) ; Cyr, Amy; Margenthaler, Julie									Journal of Surgical Research		2015	FEB 2015	193	2	519-522	519	522							Background: Atypical lesions and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are associated with an increased risk of breast malignancy. The utility of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening in this cohort of women after excision of a high-risk lesion has not been previously established. The objective of this study was to investigate outcomes of breast MRI surveillance in this subgroup of high-risk patients.Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective review of women who required excision of an atypical lesion or LCIS who underwent at least one screening breast MRI from April 2005 -December 2011. We collected information on demographics, number of second-look imaging studies recommended, number of biopsies performed and pathologic outcomes.Results: A total of 179 patients met the inclusion criteria, including 131 (73%) with atypical lesions and 48 (27%) with LCIS. Second-look imaging was recommended for 31 of 131 (23.7%) patients with atypical lesions and 8 of 48 (16.7%) with LCIS. Ten biopsies were performed in the atypical cohort (7.6%) with two revealing a malignancy (Positive Predictive Value [PPV] of 20%). In the LCIS cohort, five biopsies were performed (10.4%) with one revealing a malignancy (PPV of 20%).Conclusions: The benefit of breast MRI surveillance in patients after excision of atypical lesions or LCIS has not been clearly delineated previously. Our data demonstrate that the use of screening breast MRI in this cohort results in additional work-up in one-fifth of patients, but a PPV of only 20%. Large, prospective studies would be needed to determine whether breast cancer outcomes differ between patients undergoing conventional breast screening and those undergoing conventional breast screening plus breast MRI surveillance.

It is involved in the intratumoral activation of widely prescribed pyrimidine-derived antimetabolites such as 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine and capecitabine (Xeloda (R)). The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical correlation between TP expression in tumor tissue and the clinical outcome of capecitabine-based therapy in patients with locally advanced (stage III) or metastatic breast cancer (stage IV).Methods: The following variables were analyzed as potential determinants of benefit from a capecitabine-based therapy: TP expression, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 status, and Ki67 status. This was accomplished by immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded cancer tissues from 18 patients with breast cancer treated with at least one cycle of capecitabine. Clinical outcome was measured as time to progression.Results: TP staining intensities in both the invasive and in situ components in patients with lobular and ductal carcinomas were reported. Higher levels of TP in the invasive component were expressed in ER-negative tumors when compared with ER-positive tumors (P<0.05). The ER-positive group expressing lower levels of TP had a median time to progression of 13 months compared with the ER-negative group expressing higher levels of TP which had a median time to progression of 7.5 months (P=0.14).Conclusion: Patients with ER-positive tumors expressing lower levels of TP exhibit a longer time to progression when compared with patients with ER-negative tumors. Consequently, tumor TP expression does not seem to predict the outcome of capecitabine-based chemotherapy.														1178-6930	1178-6930	10.2147/OTT.S71089

The aim of this study was to investigate if EBV infection was more prevalent in invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma.An immunohistochemical marker for EBV (Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) clone El-2.5) was applied to a tissue micro array section. The tissue micro array contained 80 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, and 80 cases of invasive lobular carcinoma. Each case was scored as positive or negative for nuclear expression of EBNA1 in tumor cells using standard light microscopy.EBNA1 staining was evident in the tumor cells of 63 cases (39.4% of tumor cases). By tumor type (ductal/lobular) EBV infection was noted in 34(42.5%) cases of invasive ductal carcinoma and 29 (36.2%) cases of invasive lobular carcinoma, this difference was not found to be significant (P = 0.518).This study indicates that EBV infection is equally distributed across the ductal and lobular tumor types.

Two observers (M.K., H.T.) reviewed the slides of frozen sections and confirmed the presence of tumor components.Results: In additionally resected specimens, residual tumors were detected in 115 cases (52.3%) but not in 105 cases (47.7%). The primary tumor characteristics of extensive intraductal component (+), younger age, invasive lobular carcinoma and pathological T3 classification were significantly associated with the residual tumor components. The margin-exposed tumor components of the maximum diameter, number of positive margins and histological type were correlated with the residual tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that the maximum tumor diameter was an independent risk factor for residual tumors.Conclusions: Diagnosis of positive margins by intraoperative frozen section examinations was useful for predicting residual tumors, and three histological properties of the margin-exposed tumor components were correlated with the status of residual tumor components. Although it was impossible to clearly identify the single main factor for predicting patients for whom additional resections were not necessary, it may be possible to consider stratification of additional surgical therapy according to the characteristics of margin-exposed tumor components on intraoperative frozen section examinations.														0368-2811	1465-3621	10.1093/jjco/hyu158

We review the literature on (i) the specificity and heterogeneity of MC biology as documented by various analytical techniques, including the results of molecular testing for risk of recurrence; (ii) the impact of lobular histology on prediction of prognosis and effect of systemic therapies in patients. Though it is generally admitted that ILC has a better prognosis than IDC, is endocrine responsive, and responds poorly to chemotherapy, currently available data do not unanimously support these assumptions. This review demonstrates some lack of specific data and a need for improving clinical research design to allow oncologists to make informed systemic therapy decisions in patients with ILC. Importantly, future studies should compare various endpoints in ILC breast cancer patients among the group of hormonosensitive breast cancer. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

All the available demographic and tumor related data was analyzed.Results: Of 1005 breast tissues reviewed, 982 specimens were from female, and 23 from male patients. In females, 398 specimens (40.5%) were diagnosed as malignant. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) (85.2%) was most common, followed by ductal carcinoma in situ (8%), and invasive lobular carcinoma (2.7%). The mean age of Saudi females with IDC was 46.9 years. Approximately 48.7% IDC were Grade III tumors. A tumor size >2.5 cm was found in 61.1% patients, whereas axillary nodal metastasis was present in 57.1% and lympho-vascular invasion in 64.1% who underwent axillary nodal dissection. In males, 4 specimens (17.4%) were malignant (all IDC).Conclusion: Our finding are consistent with previous reports of breast cancer being diagnosed in younger age group, in advanced stages, and with features of aggressive behavior; which signals the urgency for implementation of breast screening programs.

Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention		2014	OCT 2014	23	10	2181-2185	2181	2185							Despite the widespread use of bras among U.S. women and concerns in the lay media that bra wearing may increase breast cancer risk, there is a scarcity of credible scientific studies addressing this issue. The goal of the study was to evaluate the relationship between various bra-wearing habits and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women. We conducted a population-based case-control study of breast cancer in the Seattle-Puget Sound metropolitan area that compared 454 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) cases and 590 invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2004 with 469 control women between 55 to 74 years of age. Information on bra-wearing habits and other breast cancer risk factors was collected from study participants through in-person interviews. Multivariate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using polytomous logistic regression. No aspect of bra wearing, including bra cup size, recency, average number of hours/day worn, wearing a bra with an underwire, or age first began regularly wearing a bra, was associated with risks of either IDC or ILC. Our results did not support an association between bra wearing and increased breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women.

Tissue microarray was manufactured for 114 cases of ILC and 692 cases of IDC. Immunohistochemical stains were performed as follows: glycolysis (Glut-1, hexokinase II, CAIX, MCT4), glutaminolysis (GLS1, GDH, ASCT2), mitochondria (ATP synthase, SDHA, SDHB), and serine/glycine metabolism (PHGDH, PSAT1, PSPH, SHMT1, GLDC) related proteins. Pleomorphic type (n = 12) of ILC revealed higher expression in hexokinase II, SDHB, and GLDC than classic type (n = 102) (p < 0.05). IDC showed a higher expression of glycolysis (Glut-1, CAIX, MCT4), glutaminolysis (GLS1, ASCT2), and serine/glycine metabolism (PSPH, SHMT1, GLDC) related protein than ILC in tumor cells, whereas ILC revealed higher expression in GDH, SDHA, PHGDH, and PSAT1 than IDC in tumor cells (p < 0.05). In addition, IDC demonstrated a higher expression of metabolism-related proteins than ILC in stromal tissue (p < 0.05). In ILC, tumoral GLDC positivity was correlated with higher nuclear grade (p = 0.026) and higher histologic grade (p = 0.026), and tumoral Glut-1 positivity correlated with higher histologic grade (p = 0.026). Additionally, tumoral PSPH positivity showed a significant correlation to ER negativity and PR negativity (p = 0.026). In conclusion, it reveals different expression patterns of metabolism-related proteins between IDC and ILC.														1010-4283	1423-0380	10.1007/s13277-014-2345-7

Michael; Sims, Andrew H. (andrew.sims@ed.ac.uk)									Cancer Research		2014	OCT 1 2014	74	19	5371-5376	5371	5376							Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for approximately 10% to 15% of breast carcinomas, and although it responds poorly to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, it appears to respond well to endocrine therapy. Pre- and on-treatment (after 2 weeks and 3 months) biopsies and surgical samples were obtained from 14 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) histologically confirmed ILC who responded to 3 months of neoadjuvant letrozole and were compared with a cohort of 14 responding invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) matched on clinicopathologic features. RNA was extracted and processed for whole human genome expression microarray. Dynamic clinical response was assessed using periodic three-dimensional ultrasound measurements performed during treatment and defined as a reduction of >70% in tumor volume by 3 months. Pretreatment profiles of ILC and IDC tumors showed distinctive expression of genes associated with E-cadherin signaling, epithelial adhesion, and stromal rearrangement. The changes in gene expression in response to letrozole were highly similar between responding ILC and IDC tumors; genes involved in proliferation were downregulated and those involved with immune function and extracellular matrix remodeling were upregulated. However, molecular differences between the histologic subtypes were maintained upon treatment. This is the first study of molecular changes in ILC in response to endocrine therapy to date. The genes that change on letrozole are highly consistent between ILC and IDC. Differences in gene expression between ILC and IDC at diagnosis are maintained at each time point on treatment.

Consistently, targeting these molecules has been shown to halt the growth of many tumors. The main purpose of this study was to develop surrogate biomarkers of the antitumor activity of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.Methods: Fragments from eight tumors were collected immediately after resection in ice-cold RPMI gassed with 95% O-2 :5% CO2. Viability was determined by measuring tumor cellular respiration (mitochondrial O-2 consumption). The specimens were incubated at 37 degrees C with and without 50 nM GSK2126458 (a highly potent and selective inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR) for 90 min. The tissue was then processed for histology, measurement of intracellular caspase-3 activity (using the caspase-3 substrate N-acetyl-asp-glu-val-asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin), and immunohistochemical detection of the apoptotic biomarkers caspase-3, cytochrome C, and annexin A2.Results: GSK2126458 induced morphologic changes in four tumors (two invasive ductal carcinomas, one invasive lobular carcinoma, and one ovarian dysgerminoma), intracellular caspase-3 activity in three tumors (two invasive ductal carcinomas and one poorly differentiated signet ring adenocarcinoma of gastric origin), and immunohistochemical evidence of apoptosis in at least four tumors (three invasive ductal carcinomas and one adenocarcinoma of gastric origin). Two tumors (ovarian serous carcinoma and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin) demonstrated no treatment effect.Conclusion: These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of using in vitro biomarkers for detecting antitumor activities of the rapidly emerging PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.														1475-2867		10.1186/s12935-014-0090-z

Seventy-two small primary breast carcinomas were evaluated for GHRH-R expression by immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antibody and a cutoff value of 10% staining. GHRH-R positivity was detected in 58% of all cases, 20/23 (87%) of invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC) and 22/46 (48%) of invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC). GHRH-R positivity was more frequent in grade 2 tumors (86%), as compared to grade 1 (18%) or grade 3 (47%) cancers. GHRH-R expression was not associated with mitotic scores, the Ki-67 labeling indices or nodal status. IDCs with casting-type calcifications on the mammogram showed positivity for GHRH-R in 9/12 (75%) cases. Most importantly, apocrine epithelium, and all 10 apocrine carcinomas added later to the study were GHRH-R-positive. These preliminary results suggest a greater than average GHRH-R expression in ILCs and IDCs associated with casting-type calcifications on the mammogram. Apocrine carcinomas seem uniformly positive for GHRH-R. Whether these findings could indicate a potential role of GHRH-antagonists in targeted treatment of these types of breast cancer requires further studies.

Unlike infiltrating ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) has a high tendency to metastasize to the stomach. The present study reports a case of a 53-year-old female who had undergone a modified radical mastectomy of the left breast for ILC eight years previously and presented at the clinic seeking treatment for epigastric discomfort from sour regurgitation and belching that had persisted for one month. Gastroscopy revealed multiple apophysis lesions in the stomach, which-were diagnosed as metastatic tumors to the stomach. The diagnosis was further established using histological and immunohistochemical analyses for gross cystic disease fluid protein-15, cytokeratin (CK) 7and CK20. The patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy without surgery. During the treatment, two gastroscopy procedures revealed that the apophysis lesions in the gastric body had narrowed significantly. Few cases of breast cancer metastasizing to the stomach have been reported, particularly those that have been confirmed using gastroscopy. The present study reports a case of breast cancer metastasis to the stomach to raise awareness of the condition.														1792-1074	1792-1082	10.3892/ol.2014.2260

Cancer Epidemiology		2014	AUG 2014	38	4	427-434	427	434							Background: Bone is the most common metastatic site associated with breast cancer. Using a database of women with breast cancer treated at Guy's Hospital, London 1976-2006 and followed until end 2010, we determined incidence of and survival after bone metastases. Methods: We calculated cumulative incidence of bone metastases considering death without prior bone metastases as a competing risk. Risk of bone metastases was modelled through Cox-regression. Survival after bone metastases diagnosis was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Results: Of the 7064 women, 589 (22%) developed bone metastases during 8.4 years (mean). Incidence of bone metastases was significantly higher in younger women, tumour size >5 cm, higher tumour grade, lobular carcinoma and >= four positive nodes, but was not affected by hormone receptor status. Median survival after bone metastases diagnosis was 2.3 years in women with bone-only metastases compared with <1 year in women with visceral and bone metastases. There was a trend for decreased survival for patients who developed visceral metastases early, and proportionately fewer patients in this group. Interpretation: Incidence of bone metastases has decreased but bone metastases remain a highly relevant clinical problem due to the large number of patients being diagnosed with breast cancer.

The incidence of IBTR was analyzed over time and was based on IBTR as first event.Results: The 15-year local relapse-free survival was 90.9%. The hazard estimates for IBTR showed a time course with 2 peaks, the first at approximately 5 years and the second, twice as high, at 12 years. Stratifying subjects by age and margin status showed that, for women <= 40 years old with negative margins, adjuvant systemic therapy led to a 5-fold reduced risk of recurrence compared to none, and the presence of lymph vascular space invasion (LVSI) had a 3-fold increased risk compared to its absence. For women >40 years old, the presence of LVSI (hazard ratio [HR] 2.5) and the presence of lobular carcinoma in situ in the lumpectomy specimen (HR 2.3) were the only 2 risk factors.Conclusions: We demonstrated a pattern in risk of IBTR over time, with 2 peaks, first at approximately 5 years and a second, much higher peak at approximately 12 years, especially for women <= 40 years old. For women <= 40 years old with tumor-free resection margins, we noted that the absence of adjuvant systemic therapy and the presence of LVSI were independent prognostic factors of IBTR. For women >40 years old, the presence of LVSI and the presence of lobular carcinoma in situ were independent risk factors.

For high-volume tumours like breast cancer, this association is unclear. The aim of this study is to determine to what extent the yearly surgical hospital breast cancer volume is associated with overall survival. All patients, diagnosed with primary invasive non-metastatic breast cancer in the period 2001-2005, were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Hospitals were grouped by their annual volume of surgery for invasive breast cancer. Cox proportional hazard models were used including patient and tumour characteristics as covariates. Follow-up was completed until the 1st of February 2013. Primary endpoint was 10-year overall survival rate. In total, 58,982 patients with invasive non-metastatic breast cancer were diagnosed during the period 2001-2005. Hospitals were grouped by their (mean) annual surgical volume: < 75 (n = 19), 75-99 (n = 30), 100-149 (n = 29), 150-199 (n = 9) and a parts per thousand yen200 (n = 14). The 10-year observed survival rates were 77, 81, 80, 82 and 82 %, respectively. After case-mix adjustment, patients in low-volume hospitals had a HR of 1.09 (< 75 vs. a parts per thousand yen200; 95 % CI 1.03-1.15). Survival was significantly higher for lobular carcinoma and for diagnosis in the most recent year (2005). Being a male, having a higher age at diagnosis, a higher tumour grade, a larger tumour size, a higher number of positive lymph nodes, an earlier year of diagnosis and a lower SES resulted in a reduced survival and influenced death, all to a larger extent than surgical volume did. In the Netherlands, surgical hospital volume influences 10-year overall survival only marginally and far less than patient and tumour characteristics. No difference in survival was revealed for invasive non-metastatic breast cancer patients in hospitals with 75-99 operations per year compared with hospitals with over 200 operations per year.			van der Hoeven, Koos/S-3281-2017	Wouters, Michel/0000-0001-6173-0662										0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-014-3075-7

We evaluated 5 utilization criteria recently proposed by experts. Of women (n = 340) newly diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer who underwent bilateral MRI, most (69.4%) met at least 1 criterion before MRI: mammographic density (44.4%), under consideration for partial breast irradiation (PBI) (19.7%), genetic-familial risk (12.9%), invasive lobular carcinoma (11.8%), and multifocal/multicentric disease (10.6%). MRI detected occult malignant lesion or extension of index lesion in 21.2% of index, 3.3% of contralateral, breasts. No expert criterion was associated with MRI-detected malignant lesion, which associated instead with pre-MRI plan of lumpectomy without PBI (48.2% of subjects): Odds Ratio 3.05, 95% CI 1.57-5.91 (p adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing = 0.007, adjusted for index-vs-contralateral breast and covariates).

(kingt@mskcc.org)									Cancer		2014	JUL 15 2014	120	14	2080-2089	2080	2089							The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer remains controversial. Here we review the current use of breast MRI and the impact of MRI on short-term surgical outcomes and rates of local recurrence. In addition, we address the use of MRI in specific patient populations, such as those with ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive lobular carcinoma, and occult primary breast cancer, and discuss the potential role of MRI for assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Although MRI has improved sensitivity compared with conventional imaging, this has not translated into improved short-term surgical outcomes or long-term patient benefit, such as improved local control or survival, in any patient population. MRI is an important diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients presenting with occult primary breast cancer and has shown promise in monitoring response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy; however, the data do not support the routine use of perioperative MRI in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.

(Hannah.Gilmore@UHhospitals.org)									Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine		2014	JUN 2014	138	6	814-818	814	818							Context.-The use of a touch preparation for intraoperative sentinel lymph node diagnosis has become a preferred method of many pathologists because of its reported high sensitivity and rapid turnaround time. However, after neoadjuvant chemotherapy many lymph nodes have significant treatment-related changes that may affect the diagnostic accuracy of the intraoperative evaluation.Objective.-To determine the accuracy of touch preparation for the intraoperative diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma in the neoadjuvant setting.Design.-We reviewed retrospectively the results of intraoperative evaluations for 148 different sentinel lymph nodes from 63 patients who had undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy for invasive breast cancer at our institution. The intraoperative touch preparation results were compared with the final pathology reports in conjunction with relevant clinical data.Results.-Use of touch preparation for the evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes intraoperatively after neoadjuvant therapy was associated with a low sensitivity of 38.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.4-54.5) but high specificity of 100% (95% CI, 96.5-100). There was no difference in sensitivity rates between cytopathologists and noncytopathologists in this cohort (P=.40). Patients with invasive lobular carcinoma and those who had a clinically positive axilla before the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy were the most likely to have a false-negative result at surgery.Conclusions.-Intraoperative touch preparations should not be used alone for the evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes in the setting of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer because of low overall sensitivity.														0003-9985	1543-2165	10.5858/arpa.2013-0281-OA

After systemic therapy with trastuzumab and paclitaxel followed by FEC (fluorouracil + epirubicin + cyclophosphamide), a right mastectomy was performed. By histological and immunohistochemical examinations, the resected tumor consisted mainly of E-cadherin-negative invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), and the rest was ERBB2-positive IDC; thus, the diagnosis was mixed ductal and lobular carcinoma. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed that ILC and IDC shared high-level amplification of CCND1 in homogeneously staining regions (HSR) and that IDC had an additional HSR-type amplicon of ERBB2. These findings strongly indicate that IDC and ILC had a common precursor cell with CCND1 amplification. Review of the biopsy specimen with FISH showed IDC with gene amplifications of CCND1 and ERBB2 as a minor component, IDC without amplification of CCND1 or ERBB2 as a major component, and a minute portion of ILC with CCND1 amplification. We speculate that chemotherapy and trastuzumab caused a marked reduction in IDC; however, ILC with CCND1 amplification was resistant to chemotherapy and grew.														1320-5463	1440-1827	10.1111/pin.12158

Risk factors for sBBC were evaluated in this cohort and further validated in a prospective observational validation analysis of patients between January 2012 and December 2012. Patients treated with operable unilateral breast cancer during the same period were used as a control group.Results: A total of 11,247 patients with primary breast cancer underwent operations at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between June 2007 and December 2012. The incidence of sBBC was 1.6%. The age at diagnosis (HR = 2.4, 95% C.I.: 1.4-4.0, p = 0.001), presence of sclerosing adenosis (HR = 11.8, 95% C.I.: 5.3-26.3, p<0.001), lobular carcinoma component involvement (HR = 5.6, 95% C.I.: 2.6-12.1, p<0.001), and family history of first-degree relatives with breast cancer (HR = 2.0, 95% C.I.: 1.1-3.4, p<0.001) were independent risk factors for sBBC. A subsequent validation study failed to confirm the significance of family history. No significant difference on survival was found between patients with early-stage sBBC and control cases.Conclusions: Patients with the presence of sclerosing in the affected breast, and lobular carcinoma component involvement may be at high risk for developing sBBC. This study supports the hypothesis that the host-carcinoma biological relationship, especially for the tumor microenvironment, played a critical role in the carcinogenesis of sBBC.

Breast imaging became the focus of particular attention as it is considered the most promising candidate for a first clinical application of this contrast modality. In this study, we investigate quantitative breast tissue characterization using grating-based phase-contrast computed tomography (CT) at conventional polychromatic x-ray sources. Different breast specimens have been scanned at a laboratory phase-contrast imaging setup and were correlated to histopathology. Ascertained tumor types include phylloides tumor, fibroadenoma and infiltrating lobular carcinoma. Identified tissue types comprising adipose, fibroglandular and tumor tissue have been analyzed in terms of phase-contrast Hounsfield units and are compared to high-quality, high-resolution data obtained with monochromatic synchrotron radiation, as well as calculated values based on tabulated tissue properties. The results give a good impression of the method's prospects and limitations for potential tumor detection and the associated demands on such a phase-contrast breast CT system. Furthermore, the evaluated quantitative tissue values serve as a reference for simulations and the design of dedicated phantoms for phase-contrast			Weitkamp, Timm/A-8975-2012; Herzen, Julia/B-2368-2015	Weitkamp, Timm/0000-0002-0374-0472; Herzen, Julia/0000-0002-9456-1591										0031-9155	1361-6560	10.1088/0031-9155/59/7

(Jodie.fleming@nccu.edu)									PLoS One		2014	MAR 17 2014	9	3	Article No.: e91747	e91747								The claudin-low molecular subtype of breast cancer is of particular interest for clinically the majority of these tumors are poor prognosis, triple negative, invasive ductal carcinomas. Claudin-low tumors are characterized by cancer stem cell-like features and low expression of cell junction and adhesion proteins. Herein, we sought to define the role of lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) in breast cancer and cancer cell behavior as LSR was recently correlated with tumor-initiating features. We show that LSR was expressed in epithelium, endothelium, and stromal cells within the healthy breast tissue, as well as in tumor epithelium. In primary breast tumor bioposies, LSR expression was significantly correlated with invasive ductal carcinomas compared to invasive lobular carcinomas, as well as ER alpha positive tumors and breast cancer cell lines. LSR levels were significantly reduced in claudin-low breast cancer cell lines and functional studies illustrated that reintroduction of LSR into a claudin-low cell line suppressed the EMT phenotype and reduced individual cell migration. However, our data suggest that LSR may promote collective cell migration. Re-introduction of LSR in claudin-low breast cancer cell lines reestablished tight junction protein expression and correlated with transepithelial electrical resistance, thereby reverting claudin-low lines to other intrinsic molecular subtypes. Moreover, overexpression of LSR altered gene expression of pathways involved in transformation and tumorigenesis as well as enhanced proliferation and survival in anchorage independent conditions, highlighting that reestablishment of LSR signaling promotes aggressive/tumor initiating cell behaviors. Collectively, these data highlight a direct role for LSR in driving aggressive breast cancer behavior.

The CSC hypothesis postulates that a small subpopulation of cancer cells drives tumor initiation, growth and metastasis. CSCs have been isolated from breast cancer using CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) phenotype. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the expression of CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) in two diverse breast carcinomas (ductal and lobular), and to determine the correlation between expression of CD44(+)/CD24(-/low), and clinicopathological characteristics starting from human fresh breast cancer specimens. We analyzed specimens from 57 patients using CD44 and CD24 markers by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry and correlated the CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) phenotype with clinicopathological characteristics. Moreover, mammosphere formation was tested. In all specimens tested, CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) phenotype was detectable with mean percentage of 4.73% as confirmed also by immunohistochemical analyses. A significant statistical association was found among these phenotypic groups and age, grade G3, estrogen and progesterone receptor, Ki-67 as well as lymph node metastasis. No correlation was found for histological type. In conclusion, our data showed that CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) phenotype was found at a high frequency in tumors pT2, G3, pN3, positive for Ki-67, and negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors highlighting the hypothesis that CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) profile correlates with the more aggressive clinical-pathological features of the disease.

However, recent retrospective analyses suggest that patients with ILC receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy may not benefit as much as patients with invasive ductal carcinoma. On the basis of these observations, we characterized ER function and endocrine response in ILC models. The ER-positive ILC cell lines MDA MB 134VI (MM134) and SUM44PE were used to examine the ER-regulated transcriptome via gene expression microarray analyses and ER ChIP-Seq, and to examine response to endocrine therapy. In parallel, estrogen response was assessed in vivo in the patient-derived ILC xenograft HCI-013. We identified 915 genes that were uniquely E2 regulated in ILC cell lines versus other breast cancer cell lines, and a subset of these genes were also E2 regulated in vivo in HCI-013. MM134 cells were de novo tamoxifen resistant and were induced to grow by 4-hydroxytamoxifen, as well as other antiestrogens, as partial agonists. Growth was accompanied by agonist activity of tamoxifen on ER-mediated gene expression. Though tamoxifen induced cell growth, MM134 cells required fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-1 signaling to maintain viability and were sensitive to combined endocrine therapy and FGFR1 inhibition. Our observation that ER drives a unique program of gene expression in ILC cells correlates with the ability of tamoxifen to induce growth in these cells. Targeting growth factors using FGFR1 inhibitors may block survival pathways required by ILC and reverse tamoxifen resistance. (c) 2014 AACR.

However, Only 7% of study participants had invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Because ILC has a different pattern of metastases, frequently presenting as small foci requiring immunohistochemistry for detection, the applicability of ACOSOG Z0011 trial data to ILC patients is unclear.Study Design: We identified all ILC patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (1998-2009) who met the ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria. Patients were evaluated on the basis of the extent of axillary surgery (SLND alone or ALND), and the clinical outcomes of these 2 groups were compared.Results: 1269 patients (393 SLND and 876 ALND) were identified from the SEER database. At a median follow-up time of 71 months, there were no differences in OS or disease-specific survival between the two groups.Conclusion: SLND alone may result in outcomes comparable to those achieved with ALND for patients with early-stage ILC who meet the ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria.

Ki67, histological grade and ER were evaluated and combined into a prognostic index (KiGE). All grade 1 tumours and ER-positive (ER+) grade 2 tumours with Ki67 <= 30% were classified as low-KiGE and all the others as high-KiGE.Results: Overall, 31% of the patients have died from breast cancer. The median follow-up of the patients still alive was 21 years. Age, tumour size, axillary lymph node status (nodal status), histological grade, Ki67 and KiGE were significant prognostic factors for breast cancer mortality (BCM) in univariable analysis. In a multivariable model, adjusted for adjuvant treatment, age and progesterone receptor (PgR), the strongest prognostic factors for BCM were: Nodal status (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.9, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.4-6.1), KiGE (HR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1-3.6), and tumour size (HR = 1.9, 95% CI: 0.98-3.8). By combining these three factors, 37% of the ILC's could be further divided into a low-risk group, consisting of node negative small (= 20 mm) low-KiGE tumours, with a BCM of 5% (95% CI: 1-13%) at 10 years and 12% (95% CI: 5-22%) at 20 years follow-up. None of these patients recieved chemotherapy and only 2 recieved endocrine treatment with tamoxifen.Conclusions: The combination of Ki67, histological grade and ER into KiGE, together with tumour size and nodal status make it possible to identify a large group of ILC patients with such a good long-term prognosis that chemotherapy can be safely avoided and exclusion of endocrine therapy considered.														2193-1801	2193-1801	10.1186/2193-1801-3-70

To identify such a molecule, we used a proteomic approach in the pseudopodia of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. A pseudopodial constituent was identified using excimer laser ablation, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis, mass spectroscopy, and immunocytofluorescence. MDA-MB-231 cells were modified to express various levels of this constituent by transient transfection and were examined for pseudopodia formation and migratory abilities using wound healing and two-chamber assays. Immunohistochemical positivity of human breast cancer cells (56 ILCs and 21 IDCs) was compared with clinicopathological variables. An actin-binding adaptor protein, alpha-parvin, was found to localize to pseudopodia and to form focal adhesions in cells not induced to extend pseudopodia. Pseudopodial length and density and migratory abilities correlated with alpha-parvin expression. Twenty-one (37.5 %) ILCs stained positive for alpha-parvin, whereas the results were negative for all 21 IDCs (P < 0.001). alpha-Parvin positivity in ILC was significantly associated with lymphatic invasion (P = 0.038) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.003) in univariate analyses and to lymph node metastasis (P = 0.020) in multivariate analyses. alpha-Parvin, a pseudopodial constituent, was found to promote migration of breast cancer cells and to be expressed exclusively by ILC, suggesting that alpha-parvin is an ILC-specific invasion molecule that may have clinical utility as a biomarker for aggressive subsets of ILC.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-014-2859-0

We investigated whether factors influencing pCR rate in ILC after NACT can be identified and whether clinical outcome is different. 9,020 breast cancer patients from nine German neoadjuvant trials with known histological type were pooled. 11.7 % of tumours were ILC. Endpoints were: pCR rate, surgery type and survival. ILC was associated with older age, larger tumour size, lymph node negativity, lower grade and positive hormone-receptor-status (HR). Patients with ILC achieved a significantly lower pCR rate compared with non-ILC patients (6.2 vs. 17.4 %, P < 0.001). The pCR rate was 4.2 % in ILC/HR+/G1-2, 7.0 % in ILC with either HR- or G3, and 17.8 % in ILC/HR-/G3. Mastectomy rate was higher in ILC compared with non-ILC patients irrespective of response to NACT (pCR: 27.4 vs. 16.6 %, P = 0.037 and non-pCR: 41.8 % vs. 31.5 %, P < 0.0001). Age and HR independently predicted pCR in ILC. In ILC patients, pCR did not predict distant disease free (DDFS) and loco-regional disease free survival (LRFS), but overall survival (OS). Non-pCR patients with ILC had significantly better DDFS (P = 0.018), LRFS (P < 0.0001) and OS (P = 0.044) compared with non-ILC patients. Patients with ILC had a low chance of obtaining a pCR and this is not well correlated with further outcome. The mastectomy rate was considerably high in ILC patients even after obtaining a pCR. We, therefore, suggest to offer NACT mainly to ILC patients with HR-negative tumours.				Denkert, Carsten/0000-0002-2249-0982										0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-014-2861-6

However, over the last few decades, there has been a steady decline in mortality rates due to increasingly effective adjuvant medical treatments. Mammography screening programs have increased the diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer with better prognosis. Moreover, the discovery of specific prognostic and predictive biomarkers in the past few years has enormously helped in the early detection and treatment of breast cancer. With the advent of high-throughput technologies, more and more biomarkers based on either genomics or proteomics are being explored for early detection as well as better prognosis of the breast cancer. This chapter focuses on the traditional as well as novel biomarkers that are being used or proposed to use for early prognosis, diagnosis, as well as treatment of the breast cancer to reduce morbidity as well as mortality.																	978-1-4665-8428-0(H); 978-1-4665-8429-7(P)

HER2 gene status determines the eligibility of breast cancer patients for trastuzumab therapy and a large fraction (41-56%) of these patients respond to targeted therapy. Several studies have related the increased expression of HER2 to an increased copy number of chromosome 17, rather than amplification of the HER2 gene. We compared the results of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization in both invasive ductal and invasive lobular carcinomas, to determine the frequency of chromosome 17 aneuploidy associated with discordant results. In total, 390 invasive ductal carcinomas and 180 invasive lobular carcinomas diagnosed from January 2000 to December 2005 were included in the study only if results were available for immunohistochemistry (HercepTest; DAKO, Carpinteria, California) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (PathVysion HER2 DNA Probe Kit; Abbott Laboratories, Des Plaines, Illinois). Tumors classified as invasive ductal carcinomas were graded according to the Bloom-Richardson grading system. Correlation between the results of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed for all categories. Among invasive ductal carcinomas, 29% (115/390) showed chromosome 17 aneuploidy, mostly associated with grade 3/HER2 2+ (45%) or grade 2/HER2 3+ (55%) that were not amplified. Also, 34% (12/35) of invasive lobular carcinomas showed chromosome 17 aneuploidy; approximately one-third of these cases were HER2 2+ (33%) and HER2 3+ (37%) that were not amplified. Discordance between the results of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization in both ductal and lobular carcinomas is largely associated with chromosome 17 aneuploidy.

It has been suggested to be useful in the evaluation of carcinomas of mammary or urothelial origin or metastatic carcinomas, but its distribution in normal and neoplastic tissues is incompletely mapped. In this study, we examined normal developing and adult tissues and 2040 epithelial and 460 mesenchymal or neuroectodermal neoplasms for GATA3 expression to explore its diagnostic value in surgical pathology, using monoclonal antibody (clone L50-823) and Leica Bond automated immunohistochemistry. GATA3 was expressed in trophoblast, fetal and adult epidermis, adult mammary and some salivary gland and sweat gland ductal epithelia, urothelia, distal nephron in developing and adult tissues, some prostatic basal cells, and subsets of T lymphocytes. It was expressed stronger in fetal than in adult mesothelia and was absent in respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelia. In epithelial neoplasms, GATA3 was expressed in >90% of primary and metastatic ductal and lobular carcinomas of the breast, urothelial, and cutaneous basal cell carcinomas and trophoblastic and endodermal sinus tumors. In metastatic breast carcinomas, it was more sensitive than GCDFP. Among squamous cell carcinomas, the expression was highest in the skin (81%) and lower in cervical (33%), laryngeal (16%), and pulmonary tu-mors (12%). Common positivity was found in skin adnexal tumors (100%), mesothelioma (58%), salivary gland (43%), and pancreatic (37%) ductal carcinomas, whereas frequency of expression in adenocarcinomas of lung, stomach, colon, endometrium, ovary, and prostate was <10%. Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma was a unique renal tumor with frequent positivity (51%), whereas oncocytomas were positive in 17% of cases but other types only rarely. Among mesenchymal and neuroectodermal tumors, paragangliomas were usually positive, which sets these tumors apart from epithelial neuroendocrine tumors. Mesenchymal tumors were only sporadically positive, except epithelia of biphasic synovial sarcomas. GATA3 is a useful marker in the characterization of not only mammary and urothelial but also renal and germ cell tumors, mesotheliomas, and paragangliomas. The multiple specificities of GATA3 should be taken into account when using this marker to detect metastatic mammary or urothelial carcinomas.

Tissue microarray containing 114 ILC and 692 IDC was constructed, and immunohistochemistry was performed for autophagy related protein (beclin-1, LC3A, LC3B, p62) and Ki-67. No significant difference in expression of autophagy-related proteins between pleomorphic type (n = 12) and classic type (n = 102) of ILC was observed, whereas ILC and IDC showed distinguished features that tumoral beclin-1, stromal LC3A, tumoral LC3B, tumoral p62 were highly expressed in IDC and tumoral BNIP3 was highly expressed in ILC (P < 0.001). Beclin-1 expression was correlated with ER negativity (P = 0.016) and TNBC type (P = 0.024). BNIP3 expression was correlated with ER positivity (p = 0.040). Using multivariate Cox analysis, shorter overall survival was associated with tumoral beclin-1 positivity (hazard ratio: 21.19, 95% CI: 1.098-409.1, P = 0.043). In conclusion, ILC and IDC showed different expression pattern of autophagy-related proteins in tumor and stroma that demonstrated by higher expression of tumoral beclin-1, stromal LC3A, tumoral LC3B, tumoral p62 in IDC, and higher expression of tumoral BNIP3 in ILC.														1936-2625	1936-2625

The frequency of detection of noninvasive malignant breast lesions by ultrasound-guided VABB is increasing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the ultrasound-guided VABB using Mammotome biopsy system in the early detection of breast cancer. Retrospective review between January 2008 to March 2013 the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical College. From January 2008 to March 2013, a total of 5232 ultrasound-guided VABB procedures were performed in 3985 patients whose mean ages were 36.3 years (range: 16-73). The histological results of 5232 ultrasound-guided VABB were retrospectively reviewed. Ultrasonography follow-up was performed at 3 to 6 month intervals in order to assess recurrence. Two hundred twenty three high risk lesions (comprising 59 papilloma, 57 papillomatosis, and 107 atypical hyperplasia) and 61 malignant lesions (comprising 23 ductal carcinoma in situ, 21 lobular carcinoma in situ, 12 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and 5 infiltrating mucinous carcinoma) were identified. Sensitivity (100%) and diagnostic accuracy (100%) regarding the detection of malignancy were excellent for ultrasound-guided VABB using Mammotome biopsy system. Our results indicate that ultrasound-guided VABB using Mammotome biopsy system is an accurate technique for the sampling, diagnosis, and early detection of breast cancer. It is recommended that the Mammotome biopsy system could be as the method of choice for detecting nonpalpable early breast cancer.														1940-5901

(agreeley@unc.edu) ; Wheeler, Stephanie B.; Meyer, Anne-Marie; Reeder-Hayes, Katherine E.; Biddle, Andrea K.; Muss, Hyman B.; Carpenter, William R.									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2014	JAN 2014	143	1	203-212	203	212							Existing evidence suggests that preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might not improve surgical outcomes in the general breast cancer population. To determine if patients differentially benefit from breast MRI, we examined surgical outcomes-initial mastectomy, reoperation, and final mastectomy rates-among patients grouped by histologic type. We identified women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer from 2004 to 2007 in the SEER-Medicare dataset. We classified patients as having invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), mixed ductal/lobular carcinoma (IDLC) or other histologic type. Medicare claims were used to identify breast MRI and definitive surgeries during the initial surgical treatment episode. We used propensity score methods to account for the differential likelihood of exposure to MRI. Of the 20,332 patients who met our inclusion criteria for this study, 12.2 % had a preoperative breast MRI. Patients with ILC as compared to other histologic groups were most likely to receive MRI [OR 2.32; 95 % CI (2.02-2.67)]. In the propensity score-adjusted analyses, breast MRI was associated with an increased likelihood of an initial mastectomy for all patients and among all histologic subgroups. Among patients with ILC, having a breast MRI was associated with lower odds of a reoperation [OR 0.59; 95 % CI (0.40-0.86)], and an equal likelihood of a final mastectomy compared to similar patients without a breast MRI. Overall and among patients with IDC and IDLC, breast MRI was not significantly associated with a likelihood of a reoperation but was associated with greater odds of a final mastectomy. Our study provides evidence in support of the targeted use of preoperative breast MRI among patients with ILC to improve surgical planning; it does not provide evidence for the routine use of breast MRI among all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients or among patients with IDC.

However, it is not routinely used for the primary diagnosis of hematoxylineosin-stained tissue sections.Objective.-To compare WSI using the Aperio digital pathology system (Aperio Technologies, Inc, Vista, California) with optical microscopy (OM) for the interpretation of hematoxylin-eosin-stained tissue sections of breast lesions.Design.-The study was conducted at 3 clinical sites; 3 breast pathologists interpreted 150 hematoxylin-eosinstained slides at each site, 3 times each by WSI and 3 times each by OM. For WSI, slides were scanned using an Aperio ScanScope and interpreted on a computer monitor using Aperio ImageScope software and Aperio Spectrum data management software. Pathologic interpretations were recorded using the College of American Pathologists breast checklist. WSI diagnoses were compared with OM diagnoses for accuracy, precision (interpathologist variation), and reproducibility (intrapathologist variation).Results were considered accurate only if the interpretation matched exactly between WSI and OM. The proportion of accurate results reported by each pathologist was expressed as a percentage for the comparison of the 2 platforms. Results.-The accuracy of WSI for classifying lesions as not carcinoma or as noninvasive (ductal or lobular) or invasive (ductal, lobular, or other) carcinoma was 90.5%. The accuracy of OM was 92.1%. The precision and reproducibility of WSI and OM were determined on the basis of pairwise comparisons (3 comparisons for each slide, resulting in 36 possible comparisons). The overall precision of WSI was 90.5% in comparison with 92.1% for OM; reproducibility of WSI was 91.6% in comparison with 94.5% for OM, respectively.Conclusions.-In this study, we demonstrated that WSI and OM have similar accuracy, precision, and reproducibility for interpreting hematoxylin-eosin-stained breast tissue sections. Further clinical studies using routine surgical pathology specimens would be useful to confirm these findings and facilitate the incorporation of WSI into diagnostic practice.

(reisfilj@mskcc.org)									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2013	NOV 2013	142	2	257-269	257	269							Histological special types of breast cancer have distinctive morphological features and account for up to 25 % of all invasive breast cancers. We sought to determine whether at the genomic level, histological special types of breast cancer are distinct from grade- and estrogen receptor (ER)-matched invasive carcinomas of no special type (IC-NSTs), and to define genes whose expression correlates with gene copy number in histological special types of breast cancer. We characterized 59 breast cancers of ten histological special types using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Hierarchical clustering revealed that the patterns of gene copy number aberrations segregated with ER-status and histological grade, and that samples from each of the breast cancer histological special types preferentially clustered together. We confirmed the patterns of gene copy number aberrations previously reported for lobular, micropapillary, metaplastic, and mucinous carcinomas. On the other hand, metaplastic and medullary carcinomas were found to have genomic profiles similar to those of grade- and ER-matched IC-NSTs. The genomic aberrations observed in invasive carcinomas with osteoclast-like stromal giant cells support its classification as IC-NST variant. Integrative aCGH and gene expression analysis led to the identification of 145 transcripts that were significantly overexpressed when amplified in histological special types of breast cancer. Our results illustrate that together with histological grade and ER-status, histological type is also associated with the patterns and complexity of gene copy number aberrations in breast cancer, with adenoid cystic and mucinous carcinomas being examples of ER-negative and ER-positive breast cancers with distinctive repertoires of gene copy number aberrations.

J	BCI:BCI201300753810	23317144			Ethnic differences in breast cancer risk and survival: A study on immigrants in Sweden		Mousavi, Seyed Mohsen (m.mousavi@dkfz.de) ; Foersti, Asta; Sundquist, Jan; Hemminki, Kari									Acta Oncologica (Stockholm)		2013	NOV 2013	52	8	1637-1642	1637	1642							Background. There are large geographic differences in breast cancer risk but whether survival differs between low- and high-risk groups is less well-established. As the survival of cancer depends on the level of healthcare and awareness of disease risks, subtle differences in cancer biology cannot be revealed in international comparisons. Instead, comparison of diverse immigrant groups in a country of uniformly accessible healthcare system should enable conclusions to be made about ethnic determinants of cancer risk and survival. Material and methods. The Swedish Family-Cancer Database was used to calculate standardized incidence (SIRs) and hazard ratios (HRs) of death from female breast cancer in 12 505 and 137 547 patients diagnosed with breast cancer among immigrants and Swedes, respectively. The ratios were adjusted for age, period, region, parity, and age at first childbirth. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the clinical TNM classes. The analyses were stratified by menopausal status and histology. Results. Turks, Southeast Asians, and Chileans had the lowest breast cancer risk (SIR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.37-0.51) and Iraqis the highest risk (1.19; 1.05-1.35), mainly due to premenopausal cancer (1.51; 1.27-1.78). The HRs for all breast cancers were between 0.98 (0.81-1.18) (low-risk Europeans) and 1.24 (0.94-1.63) (lowest-risk non-Europeans), but were not significant. No differences in survival of ductal carcinoma between immigrants and Swedes were found, while low-risk non-Europeans had a HR of 2.88 (1.37-6.08) for lobular carcinoma. Low-risk non-Europeans were diagnosed in a higher T-class (OR = 1.87; 1.21-2.87) than Swedes. Conclusion. We did not find any evidence that ethnic differences in breast cancer risk substantially affect the survival. The observed poor survival of some low-risk immigrants in lobular carcinoma may be related to treatment. The tendency of low-risk immigrants to present with higher T-class compared to Swedes may depend on their lower participation in the mammography screening program.														0284-186X	1651-226X	10.3109/0284186X.2012.754994

McCart; Song, Sarah; Kutasovic, Jamie R.; Reid, Lynne E.; Valle, Jordan M.; Vargas, Ana Cristina; Smart, Chanel E.; Simpson, Peter T. (p.simpson@uq.edu.au)									Virchows Archiv		2013	OCT 2013	463	4	535-545	535	545							The thromobospondins are a family of extracellular glycoproteins that are activated during tissue remodeling processes such as embryogenesis, wound healing and cancer. Thrombospondin-4 (THBS4) is known to have roles in cellular migration, adhesion and attachment, as well as proliferation in different contexts. Data to support a role in cancer biology is increasing, including for gastrointestinal and prostate tumours. Here, using a combination of immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and analysis of publicly available genomic and expression data, we present the first study describing the pattern of expression of THBS4 in normal breast and breast cancer. THBS4 was located to the basement membrane of large ducts and vessels in normal breast tissue, but was absent from epithelium and extracellular matrix. There was a significant induction in expression in cancer-associated stroma relative to normal stroma (P = 0.0033), neoplastic epithelium (P < 0.0001) and normal epithelium (P < 0.0001). There was no difference in stromal expression of THBS4 between invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC). The THBS4 mRNA levels were variable yet were generally highest in tumours typically rich in stromal content (ILC, ER positive low grade IDC; luminal A and normal-like subtypes). Genomic alterations of the THBS4 gene (somatic mutations and gene copy number) are rare suggesting this dramatic activation in expression is most likely dynamically regulated through the interaction between invading tumour cells and stromal fibroblasts in the local microenvironment. In summary, THBS4 expression in breast cancer-associated extracellular matrix contributes to the activated stromal response exhibited during tumour progression and this may facilitate invasion of tumour cells.

Current literature provides scarce information on its management. We report outcomes in 5 patients (mean age 59.4 years) with peritoneal carcinomatosis from breast cancer treated with maximal cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) by the closed technique, at 40 degrees C for 1 h with cisplatin 75 mg/m(2). The primary breast cancer was a ductal carcinoma in 3 patients and a lobular carcinoma in 2. Mean peritoneal cancer index was 20.2. In 4 of the 5 patients surgery achieved macroscopic complete cytoreduction. One patient died of disease at 56 months, 4 are alive and disease-free at 13, 45, 74 and 128 months.These encouraging outcomes suggest that cytoreduction and HIPEC is a promising approach to offer to highly selected patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from breast cancer and that this approach merit investigation in a larger series.

Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention		2013	SEP 2013	22	9	1529-1537	1529	1537							Background: Mechanistic studies largely support the chemopreventive potential of statins. However, results of epidemiologic studies investigating statin use and breast cancer risk have been inconsistent and lacked the ability to evaluate long-term statin use.Methods: We used data from a population-based case-control study of breast cancer conducted in the Seattle-Puget Sound region to investigate the relationship between long-term statin use and breast cancer risk. Nine hundred sixteen invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and 1,068 invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) cases in patients 55 to 74 years of age diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 were compared with 902 control women. All participants were interviewed in-person and data on hypercholesterolemia and all episodes of lipid-lowering medication use were collected through a structured questionnaire. We assessed the relationship between statin use and IDC and ILC risk using polytomous logistic regression.Results: Current users of statins for 10 years or longer had a 1.83-fold increased risk of IDC [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-2.93] and a 1.97-fold increased risk of ILC (95% CI: 1.25-3.12) compared with never users of statins. Among women diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia, current users of statins for 10 years or longer had more than double the risk of both IDC (OR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.17-3.57) and ILC (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.40-4.21) compared with never users.Conclusion: In this contemporary population-based case-control study, long-term use of statins was associated with increased risks of both IDC and ILC.Impact: Additional studies with similarly high frequencies of statin use for various durations are needed to confirm this novel finding.

We first compared the results of virtual touch tissue quantification according to each histologic subtype and determined the optimal cutoff values for virtual touch tissue quantification to distinguish benign from malignant tissues, using the receiver operating characteristic method. In addition, we also examined the correlation between virtual touch tissue quantification velocities and Ki-67, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 in cases of invasive ductal carcinoma using linear regression analyses and Students t-test.Virtual touch tissue quantification velocities were statistically higher in malignant cases than in benign cases (P 0.05, respectively) and the best cutoff value for the virtual touch tissue quantification velocity which could differentiate benign from malignant cases was 2.89 m/s. There were statistically significant correlations between the virtual touch tissue quantification velocity and the Ki-67 labeling index (r 0.338, r(2) 0.114 and P 0.001) and significant inverse correlations between virtual touch tissue quantification and the estrogen receptor (r 0.311, r(2) 0.097 and P 0.001) or progesterone receptor (r 0.361, r(2) 0.131 and P 0.001) status of invasive ductal carcinoma. There were also significant differences of the average velocities between human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (6.39 1.44 m/s) and -negative (4.43 1.41 m/s) cases (P 0.001).Virtual touch tissue quantification could be a valuable clinical tool for estimating breast cancer pathology in a non-invasive fashion.														0368-2811	1465-3621	10.1093/jjco/hyt098

Its role in breast cancer has not been defined. The aim of our study was to investigate the expression pattern of Axin protein in invasive breast carcinomas, in relation to the behavior and prognosis of the disease. Immunohistochemistry was performed for the detection of Axin expression in 232 breast cancer tissues. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to assess the relation of Axin expression with classic clinicopathological parameters, patients' survival and various biologic markers Human Epidermal Factor-2 (HER-2), Ki-67, topoII, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)]. Preserved cytoplasmic Axin expression was positively correlated to lymph node invasion, HER-2 and GSK-3 and inversely to Ki-67 and topoII. Nuclear Axin was positively associated with tumor size. Stromal Axin showed a parallel association with lymph node status and HER-2. In the subgroup of lobular breast carcinomas, preserved Axin was found to exert an unfavorable impact on patients' overall survival. Our findings indicate, for the first time, that in invasive breast cancer preserved Axin expression is associated with a more aggressive phenotype and that in the discrete subtype of lobular breast carcinomas Axin negatively influences patients' overall survival.														0903-4641	1600-0463	10.1111/apm.12037

Breast		2013	AUG 2013	22	4	504-509	504	509							Background: Fatigue during and after radiotherapy impacts negatively on normal functioning and quality of life. A pre-treatment estimate of the risk of fatigue would facilitate the targeting of timely interventions to limit consequential behavioural symptoms arising. We have developed a prognostic tool to predict the risk of fatigue in women with early-stage breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy.Methods: Socio-demographic, clinical and self-reported characteristics were recorded for 100 women prescribed adjuvant radiotherapy for stages Tis-T2N1 breast cancer. Multiple logistic regression was used to develop a parsimonious prognostic model. The performance of the model when predicting fatigue for individuals not in the study was estimated by a leave-one-out cross-validation. A statistical weighting was assigned to the model variables to render a Fatigue Propensity Score of between 0 and 15. The ability of the Propensity Score to discriminate fatigued participants was estimated via receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.Results: 38% of participants reported significant fatigue during radiotherapy. Fatigue risk was predicted by elevated pre-treatment fatigue and anxiety, and diagnoses other than invasive ductal carcinoma (ductal carcinoma in-situ, invasive lobular and rarer carcinoma subtypes). The positive predictive value of the prognostic model was 80%. A Propensity Score threshold of >6 corresponded to a specificity of 90.3% and a sensitivity of 76.3%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.83 for the cross-validation sample.Conclusions: Application of the Fatigue Propensity Score in the patient pathway can help direct fatigue management resources at those patients most likely to benefit.

Although clinical trials of RON targeting are underway, the intriguing issue is the diversity of RON expression as evident by cancer cells expressing different variants including oncogenic RON160. The current study determines aberrant RON160 expression in breast cancer and its potential as a target for breast cancer therapy. Using mouse monoclonal antibody Zt/h12 in immunohistochemical staining of breast cancer tissue microarray, we observed that RON160 was expressed in high frequency in primary invasive ductal (77.2%, 61/79 cases), lobular (42.5%, 34/80 cases), and lymph node-involved (63.9%, 26/36 cases) breast cancer samples. Moreover, RON160 overexpression was predominantly observed in invasive ductal (26.6%, 21/79 cases) and lymph node-involved (33.3%, 12/36) cases. Among a panel of breast cancer cell lines analyzed, Du4475 cells naturally expressed RON160. Silencing RON160 expression by siRNA reduced Du4475 cell viability. Inhibition of RON160 signaling by tyrosine kinase inhibitor PHA665752 also suppressed Du4475 cell anchorage-independent growth and induced apoptotic cell death. Studies in vivo revealed that PHA665752 inhibited 3T3-RON160 and Du4475 cell-mediated tumor growth in mouse mammary fat pad. A 60% reduction in tumor volume compared to controls was achieved after a 13-day treatment. We conclude from these studies that RON160 is highly expressed in breast cancer and its signaling is integrated into cellular signaling network for tumor cell growth and survival. Experimental treatment by PHA665752 in Du4475 breast cancer xenograft model highlights the significance of RON160 as a drug target in molecular-targeted breast cancer therapy.														1568-0096	1873-5576	10.2174/15680096113139990038

In order to approach the possibility of this common precursor of both ILC and IDC, we investigated combined lobular and ductal carcinomas. Thirty-two cases of lobular carcinoma were picked up out of 773 cases of operated breast carcinomas. The histopathological detailed re-examination using immunostain of E-cadherin and -catenin revealed a rather high frequency of combined lobular carcinomas than previous reports. Clinicopathologically, combined lobular carcinomas were younger and smaller than pure lobular carcinomas, and the cytological atypia was relatively low. These results suggested that combined lobular carcinomas could be detected in the earlier stage of breast cancer. Furthermore, the lobular and ductal components of combined carcinomas coexisted in the neighborhood and were distributed contiguously. The immunohistochemical phenotypes of both components were accorded in most combined cases. A genetic analysis using methylation-specific PCR on the HUMARA gene demonstrated that the same allele was inactivated in both lobular and ductal components in all detectable cases of combined carcinoma. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that both lobular and ductal components of combined carcinomas are clonal and derived from the LCIS as the common precursor lesion, which may contradict the conventional concept that the lobular and ductal carcinomas arise from distinct differentiation pathways.														1320-5463	1440-1827	10.1111/pin.12065																		
J	BCI:BCI201300485735	23486609			Use of immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of problematic breast lesions		Lee, Andrew H. S. (andrew.lee@nuh.nhs.uk)									Journal of Clinical Pathology (London)		2013	JUN 2013	66	6	471-477	471	477							Most diagnoses in breast pathology can be made with H&E sections. Nevertheless immunohistochemistry plays a useful supplementary role. This article reviews the common uses of immunohistochemistry in diagnostic breast pathology. It is important to be aware of the limitations of individual antibodies. Such problems can often be overcome by using panels of antibodies. Quality control is also essential: internal and external controls should show appropriate staining. Immunohistochemistry must be interpreted in combination with the morphology seen on H&E sections. Myoepithelial markers, such as smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and p63, are useful for distinguishing invasive carcinoma from sclerosing lesions and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and in the classification of papillary lesions. Basal cytokeratins can help distinguish epithelial hyperplasia of usual type (UEH) and clonal proliferations such as DCIS and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). UEH usually shows patchy expression whereas DCIS and other clonal proliferations are typically negative. E-cadherin can usually separate DCIS and LCIS: DCIS typically shows membrane staining and most LCIS is negative. Cytokeratins can be used to detect small nodal metastases or subtle invasive carcinomas such as invasive lobular carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry plays a useful role in diagnosing spindle cell lesions such as a panel of cytokeratins to identify spindle cell carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry is helpful in recognising metastases to the breast. Different antibodies are useful for different tumours: WT1 for ovarian carcinoma; TTF1 for pulmonary adenocarcinoma; S100, melan-A and HMB45 for melanoma; and lymphoid markers for lymphoma.														0021-9746	1472-4146	10.1136/jclinpath-2012-201109

However, the association of breast cancer derived IgG with genesis and development of the disease has not yet been established.Methods: In this study we examined the expression of IgG in 186 breast cancers, 20 benign breast lesions and 30 normal breast tissues. Both immunohistochemistry with antibodies to Ig kappa (immunoglobulin G kappa light chain) and Ig gamma (immunoglobulin G heavy chain) and in situ hybridization with an antisense probe to IgG1 heavy chain constant region gene were performed. Various clinicopathological features were also analyzed.Results: We found that IgG is specifically expressed in human breast cancer cells. Both infiltrating ductal carcinoma and infiltrating lobular carcinoma had significantly greater numbers of Ig kappa and Ig gamma positive cancer cells as compared with medullary carcinoma, carcinoma in situ, and benign lesions (all p<0.05). In addition, IgG expression was correlated with breast cancer histological subtypes (p<0.01) and AJCC stages (p<0.05), with more abundance of IgG expression in more malignant histological subtypes or in more advanced stage of the disease.Conclusions: IgG expression in breast cancer cells is correlated with malignancy and AJCC stages of the cancers. This suggests that breast cancer derived IgG may be associated with genesis, development and prognosis of the cancer.

J	BCI:BCI201300599943	23172133			Second harmonic generation reveals matrix alterations during breast tumor progression		Burke, Kathleen; Tang, Ping; Brown, Edward (Edward_Brown@URMC.Rochester.edu)									Journal of Biomedical Optics		2013	MAR 2013	18	3	Article No.: 031106	031106								Alteration of the extracellular matrix in tumor stroma influences efficiency of cell locomotion away from the primary tumor into surrounding tissues and vasculature, thereby affecting metastatic potential. We study matrix changes in breast cancer through the use of second harmonic generation (SHG) of collagen in order to improve the current understanding of breast tumor stromal development. Specifically, we utilize a quantitative analysis of the ratio of forward to backward propagating SHG signal (F/B ratio) to monitor collagen throughout ductal and lobular carcinoma development. After detection of a significant decrease in the F/B ratio of invasive but not in situ ductal carcinoma compared with healthy tissue, the collagen F/B ratio is investigated to determine the evolution of fibrillar collagen changes throughout tumor progression. Results are compared with the progression of lobular carcinoma, whose F/B signature also underwent significant evolution during progression, albeit in a different manner, which offers insight into varying methods of tissue penetration and collagen manipulation between the carcinomas. This research provides insights into trends of stromal reorganization throughout breast tumor development. (C) The Authors.

The products were not B-cell depleted. This report details two cases of passenger lymphocyte syndrome (PLS) after NK-cell infusion. Case Reports Patient 1 is a blood group A+ 56-year-old female with Stage IV ovarian carcinoma who received NK cells from an O+ donor. On Day +7 she developed new hemolytic anemia. Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was positive for immunoglobulinG and C3, and the eluate contained anti-A. Subsequently, anti-A was identified on reverse typing. She was transfused with group O red blood cells (RBCs). By Day +12 she forward typed as O with anti-A and B on reverse typing. By Day +42, DAT was negative with only weak anti-A on reverse typing. Patient 2 is a blood group B+ 51-year-old female with metastatic lobular breast carcinoma who received NK cells from an O+ donor. On Day +7 she developed new hemolytic anemia. DAT was positive, and the eluate contained anti-A and -B. Anti-A reactivity was due to anti-A,B. The next day she developed new anti-B on reverse typing. She was transfused with O RBCs. Anti-B titer increased to a maximum of 512 on Day +12. At discharge on Day +29 her anti-B titer was still 32. Conclusions These patients developed PLS after infusion of NK cells. Because of these cases NK-cell products are now B (CD19+)-cell depleted at our institution, and this approach is recommended for other centers.

(michael.michell@nhs.net)									Breast		2013	FEB 2013	22	1	78-82	78	82							We aim to identify preoperative factors at diagnosis which could predict whether women undergoing wide local excision (WLE) would require further operations. 1593 screen-detected invasive and non-invasive breast cancers were reviewed. Age, presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive cancer size on mammography, mammographic sign, tumour type, grade and confidence of the radiologist in malignancy were compared. 83%(1315/1593) of women had a WLE. Of these, 70%(919/1315) had a single operation, and 30%(396/1315) multiple operations. These included repeat WLE to clear margins (60%(238/396)), mastectomy (34%(133/396)) and axillary dissection (6%(25/396)). The presence of mammographic microcalcification, lobular carcinoma and grade 2 malignancy on core biopsy were independent risk factors for multiple operations on multivariate analysis. Women with mammographic DCIS >30 mm were 3.4 times more likely to undergo repeat surgery than those with smaller foci. The multidisciplinary team should pay particular attention to these factors when planning surgery. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

(stath@med.uoc.gr)									Breast		2013	FEB 2013	22	1	89-95	89	95							Background: Recently an increased interest on Elk1 protein and its role in breast cancer evolution has been noted. This protein is an element of the Ets family of transcription factors and it has been involved in a number of important cell processes through the activation of different genes, in a number of normal tissues as well as in many malignancies.Methods: One hundred and seventy (n = 170) cases of operable breast cancer (invasive ductal, lobular and mixed type breast carcinomas) were randomly selected and investigated for the expression of pElk-1, Ki-67 and Cyclin D1 using immunohistochemistry. Our findings were correlated with tumors' clinicopathologic data and biologic profile.Results: Activated Elk1 is positively associated with ER (p-value: 0.018) and also shows a positive association of with Cyclin D1 (p-value: <0.001). No relationship was noted between pElk1 and Ki67 (p-value: 0.213). Luminal A and B Her-2 negative breast cancer subtypes were showing greater pElk-1 immunoreactivity compared to Her-2 and Basal breast cancer subtypes, and also a higher staining intensity. No association of the molecule with other clinicopathologic characteristics (tumor size, stage, histological type or lymph node metastases) or disease adverse events (local recurrence, metastasis or death) was evidenced.Conclusions: Our findings offer a new perspective for the role of pElk-1 in breast neoplasia suggesting a direct relation of this molecule to tumor biology and a putative target of personalized breast cancer therapies, although its prognostic/discriminant role is not supported.

Association with carcinoma is not uncommon. There is some dilemma as to the need for excisional biopsy or follow-up after RS diagnosis on core biopsy.Aim: To determine the necessity of excisional biopsy after the diagnosis of benign RS by core biopsy.Study Design: A total of 67 RS specimens associated with benign findings on core biopsy obtained between 2003 and 2008 were reviewed. They were grouped by their accompanying histopathologic features found upon subsequent surgical excision: benign, high-risk lesion (HRL), or carcinoma. Demographic features, radiologic findings, and needle gauge were compared within subgroups.Results: After surgical excision, 15 (22.4%) patients in the benign group were upgraded to a HRL, 4 (5.9%) patients were upgraded to carcinoma, and 48 (71.6%) remained benign. We found that malignancy is associated with RS more frequently if the patient is older and postmenopausal. Other variables such as symptoms at presentation, presence and type of abnormality on mammography (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score), breast density, size of biopsy needle used, and number of core samples retrieved did not help to predict the presence of carcinoma.Conclusions: The HRL and cancer upgrade rate of RS, requiring further intervention such as surgery or chemoprevention, is 28% in this study. However, we found that age and menopausal status may be taken into consideration when making the decision to follow up or excise the RS diagnosed on core biopsy. There is insufficient data to support the predictive value of any variables. Therefore, RS associated with benign findings on core biopsy should be excised.														0277-3732	1537-453X	10.1097/COC.0b013e3182354a3f

As this tumor can resemble metastatic carcinoma with signet-ring cells, especially lobular carcinoma of the breast, it can often present a diagnostic challenge. We present a case of cutaneous signet-ring cell carcinoma presenting in the axilla and outline the challenges of diagnosing this rare malignancy.														0303-6987	1600-0560	10.1111/cup.12061

Here we describe a case report of a 65-year old woman with HBC. The patient presented with two masses in the right breast. Histopathologically, the tumors consisted of a diffuse infiltration of large tumor cells and histological components of carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular hyperplasia were also observed. The infiltration pattern was similar to that of invasive lobular carcinoma with targetoid and Indian file arrangements. The invasive histiocytoid cells had finely granular, eosinophilic to vesicular cytoplasm and nuclei with a bland uniform appearance, a single small eosinophilic nucleolus and finely granular chromatin. We compared the immunohistochemical profiles of 17 breast cancer markers between invasive carcinoma, carcinoma in situ, atypical lobular hyperplasia and normal breast epithelium. Although they all shared the same reactivity for many of the proteins, they exhibited differences in GCDFP-15, E-cadherin, P120, CEA, HER-2, ER and PR expression, and these are discussed. This is the first case study of two HBC masses occurring in one breast simultaneously. By analyzing and comparing their morphologic characteristics and spectrum of immunohistochemical expression, our study supports the view that HBC is a variant of lobular carcinoma and our findings may assist in future diagnoses of HBC.														1936-2625	1936-2625

The study utilized tumor samples from 30 metastatic patients and calculated correlations between all IHC variables. In fourteen cases, primary breast cancers paired with secondary deposits were analyzed. We evaluated the association between IHC status in the primary and secondary deposits, grade, and histotype of the tumors. The examination of the metastatic deposits in all 30 patients resulted in positive detection in the following cases: SRC3 in 20 cases (66.6%), Pax2 in 22 (73.3%), ER in 22 (73.3%), PgR in 25 (83.3%), Her2 in 10 (33.3%), EGFR in 12 (40%), CK5/6 in 7 (23.3%), and Ki67 in 23 (76.6%). Grade 2 was found in 13.3% of all patients, and grade 3 in 86.7%. SRC3 and Pax2 were positive in both G2 and G3. Invasive lobular carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma were diagnosed in 23.3% and 76.7% of cases, respectively. There were no differences between the IHC expression of the studied proteins in either grading or histotype of the tumors. In the IHC profiles, which included SRC3, Pax2, ER, PgR, Her2, CK5/6, Ki67, and EGFR, we found no statistically significant differences between the primary cancer and the brain metastasis. In our study of metastatic breast carcinoma deposits, there was no correlation between SRC3, Pax2 status and histotype, and tumor grade. The IHC status of the paired primary and metastatic deposits did not differ in a statistically significant manner.

(sasha.bernatsky@mcgill.ca)	SLICC								Oncology (Basel)		2013		85	2	117-121	117	121							Objective: Evidence points to a decreased breast cancer risk in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We analyzed data from a large multisite SLE cohort, linked to cancer registries. Methods: Information on age, SLE duration, cancer date, and histology was available. We analyzed information on histological type and performed multivariate logistic regression analyses of histological types according to age, SLE duration, and calendar year. Results: We studied 180 breast cancers in the SLE cohort. Of the 155 cases with histology information, 11 were referred to simply as 'carcinoma not otherwise specified'. In the remaining 144 breast cancers, the most common histological type was ductal carcinoma (n = 95; 66%) followed by lobular adenocarcinoma (n = 11; 8%), 15 cancers were of mixed histology, and the remaining ones were special types. In our regression analyses, the independent risk factors for lobular versus ductal carcinoma was age [odds ratio (OR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.01-1.14] and for the 'special' subtypes it was age (OR 1.06, 95% Cl 1.01-1.10) and SLE duration (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.11). Conclusions: Generally, up to 80% of breast cancers are ductal carcinomas. Though our results are not definitive, in the breast cancers that occur in SLE, there may be a slight decrease in the ductal histological type. In our analyses, age and SLE duration were independent predictors of histological status. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

(bacchi@conspat.com.br)									Applied Immunohistochemistry & Molecular Morphology		2013	JAN 2013	21	1	1-12	1	12							The distinction between classic lobular and ductal carcinoma, both in situ and invasive, has important therapeutic and management implications. Most ductal and lobular carcinomas are distinguished readily on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections because of distinct histomorphologic features. In cases with ambiguous morphologic features, however, categorization in one or another type can be a challenge. Several immunohistochemical markers, including epithelial cadherin, p120, beta-catenin, and low-molecular-weight and high-molecular-weight cytokeratins among others, have been introduced to help better discriminate between lobular neoplasia and ductal carcinoma. In this critical review of the literature, we comment about the usefulness and the limitations of these markers to improve the accuracy in the differential diagnosis of breast pathology.

Chuck; Borges, Virginia F.; Post, Miriam D.; Sollender, Grace E.; Spillman, Monique A.; Horwitz, Kathryn B.; Jacobsen, Britta M. (Britta.Jacobsen@ucdenver.edu)									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2013	JAN 2013	137	2	431-448	431	448							Mucinous breast cancer (MBC) is mainly a disease of postmenopausal women. Pure MBC is rare and augurs a good prognosis. In contrast, MBC mixed with other histological subtypes of invasive disease loses the more favorable prognosis. Because of the relative rarity of pure MBC, little is known about its cell and tumor biology and relationship to invasive disease of other subtypes. We have now developed a human breast cancer cell line called BCK4, in which we can control the behavior of MBC. BCK4 cells were derived from a patient whose poorly differentiated primary tumor was treated with chemotherapy, radiation and tamoxifen. Malignant cells from a recurrent pleural effusion were xenografted in mammary glands of a nude mouse. Cells from the solid tumor xenograft were propagated in culture to generate the BCK4 cell line. Multiple marker and chromosome analyses demonstrate that BCK4 cells are human, near diploid and luminal, expressing functional estrogen, androgen, and progesterone receptors. When xenografted back into immunocompromised cycling mice, BCK4 cells grow into small pure MBC. However, if mice are supplemented with continuous estradiol, tumors switch to invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) with mucinous features (mixed MBC), and growth is markedly accelerated. Tamoxifen prevents the expansion of this more invasive component. The unexpected ability of estrogens to convert pure MBC into mixed MBC with ILC may explain the rarity of the pure disease in premenopausal women. These studies show that MBC can be derived from lobular precursors and that BCK4 cells are new, unique models to study the phenotypic plasticity, hormonal regulation, optimal therapeutic interventions, and metastatic patterns of MBC.

BMP4 has an indispensable role in vertebrate development while limited information on BMP4 expression and function exists in adult tissues. Nevertheless, its contribution to cancer development and progression has gained increasing interest in recent years. Functional studies, especially in breast cancer, have implicated BMP4 both in inhibition of cell proliferation and in promotion of cell migration and invasion. To gain an insight into the function of BMP4 in normal and cancer tissues, BMP4 protein expression levels were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 34 different normal organs/tissues, 34 different tumor types and finally in 486 breast cancer samples where possible associations between BMP4 and clinicopathological parameters were statistically evaluated. In over 20% of normal and malignant tissues, BMP4 was expressed at high level. Strong expression was observed particularly in some normal epithelial cells, such as bladder and stomach, and in squamous cell carcinomas. In breast cancer, strong BMP4 expression was detected in 25% of patients, and was associated with low proliferation index and increased frequency of tumor recurrence. Taken together, BMP4 is expressed in a subset of normal adult tissues and is likely to contribute to tissue homeostasis. However, in tumors, BMP4 expression levels vary considerably, implying diverse roles in different tumor types. This role is biphasic in breast cancer as BMP4 expression is linked to reduced proliferation and increased recurrence, thus corroborating our previous in-vitro functional data.

American Journal of Clinical Pathology		2013	JAN 2013	139	1	62-70	62	70							Pathologists are expected to accurately diagnose increasingly smaller breast carcinomas. Correct classification (ie, lobular vs ductal or in situ vs invasive) directly affects subsequent management, especially when the focus is near a surgical margin or present in a needle core biopsy and is further challenging if the lesion is morphologically ambiguous. We assessed the diagnostic utility of a multiplex, trichromogen immunostain of 3 commonly employed antibodies (CK7, p63, and E-cadherin) developed in our laboratory to evaluate these small lesions. Of the 147 specimens containing minimal (defined as <= 3 mm in size) invasive carcinoma, 81 also contained in situ carcinoma. In each case, the Minimal Carcinoma Triple Stain was prepared with a parallel H&E-stained slide. Observations of staining characteristics in the focus of interest were recorded. The Minimal Carcinoma Triple Stain was diagnostically useful in all but 1 case. In a case of invasive lobular carcinoma in an excisional biopsy, the Minimal Carcinoma Triple Stain stained only the surrounding breast tissue (appropriately) and not the focus of interest. Also, a subset of 29 of 81 excisional biopsies had minimal invasive carcinoma located 2 mm or less from the inked surgical margin, in which in all cases the Minimal Carcinoma Triple Stain was fully interpretable despite morphologic distortion due to concomitant cautery artifact and tissue disruption in some cases. The Minimal Carcinoma Triple Stain offers an accurate and tissue-conserving method to diagnose small, morphologically problematic foci of breast carcinoma while ideally leaving more tissue for additional adjunctive studies.														0002-9173	1943-7722	10.1309/AJCPF4O0ADKFMGRJ

A rare cause of vaginal bleeding in these patients is breast carcinoma metastasis in an endometrial polyp. We describe a 67-yr-old patient with metastasis of lobular breast carcinoma in an endometrial polyp and papillary serous endometrial carcinoma, both diagnosed simultaneously in a uterine curettage. The coexistence of the 2 cancers was confirmed by pathologic study of the hysterectomy specimen. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of the synchronous presence of the 2 neoplastic diseases.

Expression of YKL-40 of 120 Chinese patients with breast cancer and 30 controls (benign breast lesions) was measured in tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry and in serum by ELISA. Differences in YKL-40 positivity grouped by specific patients' characteristics were compared using Pearson Chi-square test for rates of intratumoral staining, one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post-hoc comparison, or two-sample t-test for mean YKL-40 serum concentrations. Factors associated with overall survival were identified by univariate and multivariate cox-regression analyses. YKL-40 was elevated in approximately 75% of Chinese patients with breast cancer. A significantly higher percentage of patients with YKL-40 positive tumors had larger tumor size, higher TNM stage, and/or lymph node metastasis. Significantly higher mean YKL-40 serum concentrations were observed in patient subgroups with invasive lobular carcinoma (P < 0.0167), higher TNM stage (P < 0.001), and positive lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001). The estimated mean survival time of patients with YKL-40 positive tumors was significantly shorter than for patients with YKL-40 negative tumors (55.13 months vs 65.78 months, P=0.017). Multivariable Cox-regression analysis identified a significant association of overall survival time with YKL-40 serum concentration. Patients with YKL-40 positive tumors had significantly shorter disease free survival times than those with YKL-40 negative tumors. We propose that the potential utility of YKL-40 intratumoral staining or serum concentration as a biomarker for breast cancer is greatest within 5 years of diagnosis.														1932-6203	1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0051127

(aedrag01@louis-ville.edu)									American Journal of the Medical Sciences		2012	DEC 2012	344	6	452-456	452	456							Introduction: In keeping with recently documented national trends, a significant and increasing number of patients will have chosen contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) based on personal preference, without traditional clinical or pathological indication. Methods: Women who underwent CPM at the University of Louisville from 2003 to 2009 were selected for this study. Descriptive factors were evaluated such as age, race, family history of breast cancer, laterality, hormone receptor status, stage, grade and histology of the index breast lesion. Statistical analysis was used to compute predictive factors for occult contralateral pathology. Results: A total of 107 patients underwent CPM and had adequate medical information to be included in this study. The median age was 48 years, with 88% being white and 12% being African American. Seventy-six percent of the index breast cancers were infiltrating ductal carcinoma and 12% were infiltrating lobular carcinoma. Five "significant" occult pathologies were found in the prophylactically removed breast. Two of the lesions were ductal carcinoma in situ, 2 were lobular carcinoma in situ and 1 was an invasive mucinous carcinoma. On bivariate analysis, there were no factors identified predictive for occult contralateral pathology. Conclusions: In line with previously reported data, we noted that fewer than 5% of patients who underwent CPM had pathology in the contralateral breast. We were unable to correlate any clinical or pathological characteristics in women who presented with contralateral breast cancer. This study raises serious questions regarding the clinical utility of CPM in detecting synchronous clinically and radiographically occult contralateral primaries.														0002-9629	1538-2990	10.1097/MAJ.0b013e31824a82ce																		
J	BCI:BCI201300107479	23008060			HIF-1 alpha and NOTCH signaling in ductal and lobular carcinomas of the breast		Ercan, Cigdem; Vermeulen, Jeroen F.; Hoefnagel, Laurien; Bult, Peter; van der Groep, Petra; van der Wall, Elsken; van Diest, Paul J. (P.J.vanDiest@umcutrecht.nl)									Cellular Oncology		2012	DEC 2012	35	6	435-442	435	442							NOTCH signaling is involved in every step of metazoan development and maintenance of adult tissue homeostasis. It is frequently deregulated by mutations and overexpression in different cancer types including solid tumors such as breast cancer. Another common feature of solid tumors is hypoxia, which occurs due to defective or insufficient vascularization. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are key regulators of the homeostatic response to low oxygen levels. HIF-1 alpha is overexpressed in many solid tumors, including breast cancer. Hypoxia-induced stabilization of HIF transcription factors has been shown to lead to NOTCH activation in vitro in different contexts and tissues, causing differentiation arrest and induction of proliferation and migration.Since the link between HIF-1 alpha and NOTCH signalling has hardly been studied, we set out to closely investigate associations between the expression of HIF-1 alpha and NOTCH pathway members in primary and metastatic human breast cancer specimens and their prognostic value.Co-expression of NOTCH1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) and HIF-1 alpha was associated with a high grade and a high proliferation rate in invasive breast cancer. HIF-1 alpha expression was low in classic, but high in pleomorphic lobular cancers, which also frequently showed stromal HIF-1 alpha expression. NOTCH1 pathway activation was prognostically unfavorable.In breast cancer, NOTCH pathway activation appears to be associated with a poor prognosis, but NOTCH and HIF signaling do not seem to be functionally associated.

Using a two-dimensional electrophoresis matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry investigation coupled to an immunohistochemical approach, we have assessed the expression of alpha B-crystallin in IDCAs, as well as, in other types of breast tumors (invasive lobular carcinomas, medullary carcinomas, and in situ ductal carcinomas). Correlation between alpha B-crystallin expression and clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer has also been investigated. Proteomic analyses revealed an increased expression of alpha B-crystallin in IDCA tumors compared to adjacent nontumor tissues. Overexpression of this molecular chaperone was further confirmed in 51 tumor specimens. Statistical analyses revealed, however, no significant correlations between alpha B-crystallin expression and clinicopathological parameters of the disease (tumor stage, patient age, hormone receptors, SBR grade, and lymph node metastases). This study demonstrates the upregulation of alpha B-crystallin in IDCA tissues which may highlight its possible involvement in breast cancer development. Our findings do not, however, support the involvement of this molecular chaperone in the progression of this disease.														1010-4283	1423-0380	10.1007/s13277-012-0490-4

(troxellm@ohsu.edu)									Diagnostic Molecular Pathology		2012	DEC 2012	21	4	221-224	221	224							Morphologic "special types" of breast carcinomas have been recognized for many years, and their molecular and genetic properties have not been specifically studied until recently. Lobular carcinoma lacks functional E-cadherin expression but shares molecular similarities with low-grade invasive ductal carcinomas. Papillary carcinoma is relatively rare, and molecular features are just being elucidated. We report a case of concurrent invasive lobular and papillary carcinoma, the latter with extensive nodal involvement. Multiplex screening for activating point mutations identified different point mutations in the distinct morphologic components: lobular PIK3CA H1047R, papillary; PIK3CA Q546P, and IDH1 R132H. These molecular data favor coincidental "collision tumors" over clonal evolution. The IDH1 R132H point mutation is common in gliomas and acute myelogenous leukemia, but this has not been previously reported in breast carcinoma. The characterization of activating point mutations in morphologic special types of breast carcinoma may suggest avenues amenable to targeted therapy.														1052-9551	1533-4066	10.1097/PDM.0b013e31826ddbd1

International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics		2012	DEC 1 2012	84	5	1116-1122	1116	1122							Purpose: To determine an appropriate clinical target volume for partial breast radiation therapy (PBRT) based on the spatial distribution of residual invasive and in situ carcinoma after wide local excision (WLE) for early breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Methods and Materials: We performed a prospective pathologic study of women potentially eligible for PBRT who had re-excision and/or completion mastectomy after WLE for early breast cancer or DCIS. A pathologic assessment protocol was used to determine the maximum radial extension (MRE) of residual carcinoma from the margin of the initial surgical cavity. Women were stratified by the closest initial radial margin width: negative (>1 mm), close (>0 mm and <= 1 mm), or involved.Results: The study population was composed of 133 women with a median age of 59 years (range, 27-82 years) and the following stage groups: 0 (13.5%), I (40.6%), II (38.3%), and III (7.5%). The histologic subtypes of the primary tumor were invasive ductal carcinoma (74.4%), invasive lobular carcinoma (12.0%), and DCIS alone (13.5%). Residual carcinoma was present in the re-excision and completion mastectomy specimens in 55.4%, 14.3%, and 7.2% of women with an involved, close, and negative margin, respectively. In the 77 women with a noninvolved radial margin, the MRE of residual disease, if present, was <= 10 mm in 97.4% (95% confidence interval 91.6-99.5) of cases. Larger MRE measurements were significantly associated with an involved margin (P<.001), tumor size >30 mm (P=.03), premenopausal status (P=.03), and negative progesterone receptor status (P=.05).Conclusions: A clinical target volume margin of 10 mm would encompass microscopic residual disease in >90% of women potentially eligible for PBRT after WLE with noninvolved resection margins.

We investigated gene expression differences between ILCs and IDCs and their correlation with variations in invasiveness and tumor growth. Total RNA was isolated from 30 frozen tumor samples: 10 from ILCs and 20 from IDCs. Gene expression was investigated using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Data and validation were performed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Gene expression differences between ILCs and IDCs were found in 140 genes. Overall, ILCs showed up-regulation of genes related with cell migration, lipid and fatty acid metabolism, and some transcription factors and showed down-regulation of cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton, cell proliferation, and energetic metabolism of the tumor cells. Our reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results showed that PLEKHA and TMSB10 expression discriminated ILCs from luminal A IDCs, whereas PLEKHA7, TMSB10, PRDX4, and SERPINB5 discriminated ILCs from luminal B IDCs. At the protein level, Plekha7 was overexpressed in ILCs but not in normal tissue or low-grade IDCs. Moreover, Plekha7 overexpression had an inverse relation with E-cadherin expression. The gene expression profile in ILCs and IDCs differs in several signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that overexpression of PLEKHA 7 is common in ILCs and could be a molecular marker to differentiate ILCs from IDCs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To date, the focus of such algorithms in the breast cancer setting has been on traditional markers in the common invasive ductal carcinoma subtype. Here, we aimed to optimize and validate an automated analysis of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 in a large collection of invasive lobular carcinoma and relate its expression to clinicopathologic data. The image analysis algorithm was trained to optimally match manual scoring of cyclin D1 protein expression in a subset of invasive lobular carcinoma tissue microarray cores. The algorithm was capable of distinguishing cyclin D1 positive cells and illustrated high correlation with traditional manual scoring (kappa = 0.63). It was then applied to our entire cohort of 483 patients, with subsequent statistical comparisons to clinical data. We found no correlation between cyclin D1 expression and tumor size, grade, and lymph node status. However, overexpression of the protein was associated with reduced recunrrence-free survival (P = .029), as was positive nodal status (P < .001) in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma. Finally, high cyclin D1 expression was associated with increased hazard ratio in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.89). In conclusion, we describe an image analysis algorithm capable of reliably analyzing cyclin D1 staining in invasive lobular carcinoma and have linked overexpression of the protein to increased recurrence risk. Our findings support the use of cyclin D1 as a clinically informative biomarker for invasive lobular breast cancer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Shelley (shelley.hwang@duke.edu)	I-SPY TRIAL Investigators								Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2012	NOV 2012	136	1	35-43	35	43							Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) has been reported to be less responsive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) than invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). We sought to determine whether ILC histology indeed predicts poor response to NAC by analyzing tumor characteristics such as protein expression, gene expression, and imaging features, and by comparing NAC response rates to those seen in IDC after adjustment for these factors. We combined datasets from two large prospective NAC trials, including in total 676 patients, of which 75 were of lobular histology. Eligible patients had tumors a parts per thousand yen3 cm in diameter or pathologic documentation of positive nodes, and underwent serial biopsies, expression microarray analysis, and MRI imaging. We compared pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and breast conservation surgery (BCS) rates between ILC and IDC, adjusted for clinicopathologic factors. On univariate analysis, ILCs were significantly less likely to have a pCR after NAC than IDCs (11 vs. 25 %, p = 0.01). However, the known differences in tumor characteristics between the two histologic types, including hormone receptor (HR) status, HER2 status, histological grade, and p53 expression, accounted for this difference with the lowest pCR rates among HR+/HER2- tumors in both ILC and IDC (7 and 5 %, respectively). ILC which were HR- and/or HER2+ had a pCR rate of 25 %. Expression subtyping, particularly the NKI 70-gene signature, was correlated with pCR, although the small numbers of ILC in each group precluded significant associations. BCS rate did not differ between IDC and ILC after adjusting for molecular characteristics. We conclude that ILC represents a heterogeneous group of tumors which are less responsive to NAC than IDC. However, this difference is explained by differences in molecular characteristics, particularly HR and HER2, and independent of lobular histology.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-012-2233-z

A whole-genome study using single nucleotide polymorphism array found a significantly higher frequency of loss of heterozygosity on 3p in invasive ductal carcinoma when compared with invasive lobular carcinoma. In this study, we performed a loss of heterozygosity analysis of the 3p chromosome region in ductal and lobular breast tumors. Seven microsatellite markers were evaluated in a series of 136 sporadic breast cancer cases (118 invasive ductal carcinoma and 18 invasive lobular carcinoma) and correlated with clinical-histopathologic parameters from the patients. A significantly higher frequency of loss of heterozygosity was observed in invasive ductal carcinoma (65.3%) when compared with invasive lobular carcinoma (38.9%). When the markers were analyzed separately, loss of heterozygosity at 3 of them, D351307 in 3p26.3, D3SI286 in 3p24.3, and D3SI300 in 3p14.2, were significantly more frequent in ductal than in lobular tumors. D3SI307 marker showed the highest frequency of loss of heterozygosity in invasive ductal carcinoma (46.2%), and associations between loss of this marker and loss of estrogen and progesterone receptors were found in these samples. Our results confirm the observations that invasive ductal carcinoma has a higher frequency of loss of heterozygosity events across the 3p region than invasive lobular carcinoma and show that specific losses on 3p26.3, 3p24.3, and 3p14.2 regions are more frequent in ductal than in lobular tumors. We discuss our data in relation to the known tumor suppressor genes that are mapped at the 3p loci investigated and their present relevant roles in breast cancer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Results of a 5-year prospective study		Uzoaru, Ikechukwu (ike.uzoaru@carle.com) ; Morgan, Bradley R.; Liu, Zheng G.; Bellafiore, Frank J.; Gaudier, Farah S.; Lo, Jeanne V.; Pakzad, Kourosh									Virchows Archiv		2012	OCT 2012	461	4	419-423	419	423							Flat epithelial atypia (FEA) of the breast have a tendency to calcify and, as such, are becoming increasingly detected by mammography. There is no consensus yet on whether to excise these lesions or not after diagnosis on core needle biopsies (CNB). We reviewed 3,948 cases of breast CNB between June 2004 and June 2009 correlating histomorphologic, radiological, and clinical features. There were 3.7 % (145/3,948) pure FEA and 1.5 % (58/3,948) concomitant FEA and atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH). In the pure FEA population, 46.2 % (67/145) had microcalcifications on mammography with 65.5 % (95/145) of patients undergoing subsequent excisional biopsies with the following findings: benign 20 % (19/95), ADH 37.9 % (36/95), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) 1.1 % (1/95), and DCIS and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) 2.1 % (2/95). In the concomitant FEA and ADH group, 86.2 % (50/58) patients had microcalcifications on radiograph with 74.1 % (43/58) of patients undergoing subsequent excisions with: benign 23.3 % (10/43), DCIS 9.3 % (4/43), DCIS and IDC 4.7 % (2/43), DCIS + lobular carcinoma in situ + invasive lobular carcinoma 2.3 % (1/43), and tubular carcinoma 2.3 % (1/43). The incidence of carcinoma in the FEA + ADH group is 18.6 % (8/43) and 3.2 % (3/95) for the pure FEA group. This difference is statistically significant (p = 0.0016). The relative risk of carcinoma in the ADH + FEA group versus the pure FEA group is 6.4773, with 95 % CI of 1.8432 and 22.76 24. Five-year mean follow-up in the unexcised pure FEA did not show any malignancies. These findings suggest that pure FEA has a very low association with carcinoma, and these patients may benefit from close clinical and mammographic follow-up while the combined pure FEA and ADH cases may be re-excised.														0945-6317	1432-2307	10.1007/s00428-012-1312-1

(sgainer@mdanderson.org) ; Lodhi, Ashutosh K.; Bhattacharyya, Anirban; Krishnamurthy, Savitri; Kuerer, Henry M.; Lucci, Anthony									Journal of Surgical Research		2012	SEP 2012	177	1	93-96	93	96							Background: Invasive lobular carcinomas (ILCs) are almost always estrogen receptor (ER) positive. Most delayed breast cancer recurrences occur in ER-positive patients. Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been implicated in recurrence. The purpose of this study was to determine whether DTCs and CTCs are associated with ILCs in stage I-III breast cancer.Materials and methods: Clinical stage I-III breast cancer patients consented to participate in an institutional review board-approved study involving collection of bone marrow and blood at surgery for primary breast cancer. We assessed DTCs by anti-CK antibody cocktail after cytospin. We detected CTCs using Cell Search, and defined them as nucleated cells lacking CD45 but expressing cytokeratin. One or more cells per 5 mL bone marrow or 7.5 mL blood was considered positive. We performed statistical analyses using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests.Results: We prospectively enrolled 422 patients, 64 with ILC and 358 with invasive ductal carcinoma. Estrogen receptor positivity was higher in ILCs (92.2% versus 66.2%) {P = .001}. We identified DTCs to be 43.4% with ILC compared with 28.9% with IDC {P = 0.03}. The CTC rates were similar. Either DTCs or CTCs were identified in 75.6% with ILC, compared with 51.7% with invasive ductal carcinoma {P = .002}. We observed no correlation between the presence of DTCs and CTCs in ILC patients and tumor size, grade, hormone receptor status, stage, lymph node status, or administration of NACT.Conclusions: Invasive lobular carcinomas independently predicted micrometastatic disease. Because most late recurrences are ER positive, this raises the question of whether DTCs and CTCs are indeed responsible for late breast cancer recurrence. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Breast cancer as well as lobular carcinoma is associated with various risk factors such as gender, age, female hormone exposure, ethnicity, family history and genetic risk factor-associated genes. Genes associated with a high risk of developing breast cancer include BRCA1, BRCA2, p53, PTEN, CHEK2 and ATM. Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone therapy are used to treat breast cancer but these therapies, except for surgery, have many side-effects such as alopecia, anesthesia, diarrhea and arthralgia. Gene-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy (GEPT) or suicide gene therapy, may improve the therapeutic efficacy of conventional cancer radiotherapy and chemotherapy without side-effects. GEPT most often involves the use of a viral vector to deliver a gene not found in mammalian cells and that produces enzymes which can convert a relatively non-toxic prodrug into a toxic agent. Examples of these systems include cytosine deaminase/5-fluorocytosine (CD/5-FC), carboxyl esterase/irinotecan (CE/CPT-11), and thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (TK/GCV). Recently, therapies based on genetically engineered stem cells (GESTECs) using a GEPT system have received a great deal of attention for their clinical and therapeutic potential to treat breast cancer. In this review, we discuss the potential of GESTECs via tumor tropism effects and therapeutic efficacy against several different types of cancer cells. GESTECs represent a useful tool for treating breast cancer without inducing injuries associated with conventional therapeutic modalities.														1019-6439	1791-2423	10.3892/ijo.2012.1523

(kleer@umich.edu)									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2012	AUG 2012	135	1	59-66	59	66							Breast cancer in African-American women has a worse outcome than in Caucasian women. The ancestors of most African-American women come from West Africa, including Ghana. The Polycomb group protein EZH2 is a marker of poor outcome in breast cancers from Caucasian women. The histopathological features and biomarker expression of African breast cancers remain obscure. Here, we investigated a cohort of Ghanaian breast cancers to better define the prevalent tumor types and to test if EZH2 protein may identify aggressive tumors. A group of 169 breast tissues (100 invasive carcinomas and 69 benign) from women treated at Komfo Anoyke Teaching Hospital between 2006 and 2011 were histologically classified and investigated for EZH2 expression. EZH2 nuclear expression we defined as high or low following previously published criteria. Of the 100 invasive carcinomas, 89 % were ductal, 2 % were lobular, and 9 % were metaplastic. Basal-like pathological features were present in 30 % of the tumors. Of the invasive carcinomas, 7 % were grade 1, 41 % grade 2, and 52 % grade 3. EZH2 protein was overexpressed in invasive carcinomas compared to benign breast (p < 0.0001). In invasive carcinomas nuclear EZH2 overexpression was significantly associated with basal-like subtype (p = 0.03) and high histologic grade (p < 0.05). Cytoplasmic EZH2, which has not been previously reported, was present in 16 % of invasive carcinomas and it was associated with triple negative status (p = 0.02). Our results provide the first comprehensive histopathological study of this patient population and uncover the association of EZH2 with high grade and basal-like tumors. We provide the basis for further detailed investigations on this cohort to advance diagnosis and treatment of African and African-American women.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-012-2055-z

Aberrant expression of TopBP1 may lead to genomic instability and can have pathological consequences. In this study we aimed to investigate expression of TopBP1 gene at mRNA and protein level in hereditary breast cancer. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in 127 breast cancer samples. Expression of TopBP1 mRNA in lobular carcinoma was significantly lower compared with ductal carcinoma (p < 0.05). The level of TopBP1 mRNA appeared to be lower in poorly differentiated (III grade) hereditary breast cancer in comparison with moderately (II grade) and well-differentiated cancer (I grade) (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 respectively). We analyzed TopBP1 protein expression using immunohistochemistry and Western blot techniques. Expression of TopBP1 protein was found to be significantly increased in poorly differentiated breast cancer (III grade) (p < 0.05). The percentage of samples with cytoplasmic apart from nuclear staining increased with increasing histological grade. There was no significant association between level and intracellular localization of TopBP1 protein in hereditary breast cancer and other clinicopathological parameters such as estrogen and progesterone receptors status, appearance of metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes and type of cancer. Our data suggest that decreased level of TopBP1 mRNA and increased level of TopBP1 protein might be associated with progression of hereditary breast cancer.

Adequate treatment of this neoplasm consists of local excision. MFB shows characteristic histological features and a clear immunohistochemical profile and usually does not cause any diagnostic difficulties [1-4]. A rare variant of MFB such as the epithelioid subtype with sclerotic stroma, however, can resemble lobular carcinoma in routinely stained histological sections.														1233-9687

The clinicopathological features and prognosis of other minor types concerning the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) were evaluated in this study.A total of 562 patients were classified according to the Japanese and the World Health Organization (WHO) classifications, and the number of IDC and other special types (SP) was 500 and 62. The SP patients had a significantly poorer clinicopathological response to NAC and less breast-conservative therapy than those with IDC. According to the WHO classification, mucinous carcinoma, metaplastic carcinomas and apocrine carcinoma also responded poorly, and patients with metaplastic carcinomas and invasive lobular carcinoma had a significantly poorer prognosis. Despite the poor response to chemotherapy, patients with mucinous carcinoma and apocrine carcinoma had a good prognosis.The response to NAC and the prognosis vary for each histological type. For some types, the prognosis was not related to the clinicopathological response to NAC.Background: In the treatment of breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has become the standard treatment modality for downstaging purposes. Although effective regimens have been established for the treatment of invasive ductal carcinoma-not otherwise specified (IDC), the data about the efficacy and prognosis for patients with other minor types of breast cancer are insufficient because of the rareness of these tumors. Defining the relationship between each histological type and the clinicopathological response to NAC is essential to optimizing individualized treatment.Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the clinicopathological features and classification of the histological types based on the Japanese and the World Health Organization (WHO) classifications before and after NAC in 562 patients with primary breast cancer who underwent curative treatment after NAC between 1998 and 2008. The prognosis was estimated for each histological type.Results: Of the 562 patients, the number of cases of IDC and other special types (SP) was 500 and 62. In the SP group, the clinicopathological response to NAC was significantly poorer, and the patients underwent breast-conservative therapy less frequently than did the IDC patients. According to the WHO classification, mucinous carcinoma, metaplastic carcinomas and apocrine carcinoma responded poorly to NAC. The disease-free survival and overall survival were significantly worse for patients with metaplastic carcinomas (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001) and with invasive lobular carcinoma (p = 0.03 and p < 0.001) than other cancers. Despite their poor response to treatment, patients with mucinous carcinoma and apocrine carcinoma had a good prognosis.Conclusions: The response to standardized NAC and prognosis varies for each histological type. For some types, the prognosis was not associated with the clinicopathological response to NAC. Innovative regimens should therefore be investigated for each histological type to achieve the best response. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We used a descriptive epidemiological method and data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry (19792007) to examine secular trends in the age-specific incidences of female breast cancer, three major female genital tract cancers and the histopathological subtypes of these cancers. Age-specific incidence rates in the United States (19782002) were used as an external reference, and the incidence rates of all malignancies and of malignant brain tumors were used as internal references. We found that age-adjusted incidence rates of female breast, uterine, and ovarian cancers increased in Taiwan from 1979 to 2007, whereas the incidence of cervical cancer decreased after 1998. The largest increase was observed for ductal and lobular carcinomas of the breast and endometrioid carcinomas of the uterus and ovary in women =55 years, all of these tumors show a high prevalence of hormone receptor expressions. In addition, hormone-receptor-positive rates of breast cancer were uniquely higher in younger, as opposed to older, Taiwanese women. These findings indicate that estrogen-related cancers rapidly emerge in young women in Taiwan and that incidence rates are catching up with that of women living in the United States.

(p.w.b.derksen@umcutrecht.nl)									PLoS One		2012	MAY 25 2012	7	5	Article No.: e37864	e37864								Kaiso is a BTB/POZ transcription factor that is ubiquitously expressed in multiple cell types and functions as a transcriptional repressor and activator. Little is known about Kaiso expression and localization in breast cancer. Here, we have related pathological features and molecular subtypes to Kaiso expression in 477 cases of human invasive breast cancer. Nuclear Kaiso was predominantly found in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) (p = 0.007), while cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was linked to invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) (p = 0.006). Although cytoplasmic Kaiso did not correlate to clinicopathological features, we found a significant correlation between nuclear Kaiso, high histological grade (p = 0.023), ER alpha negativity (p = 0.001), and the HER2-driven and basal/triple-negative breast cancers (p = 0.018). Interestingly, nuclear Kaiso was also abundant in BRCA1-associated breast cancer (p < 0.001) and invasive breast cancer overexpressing EGFR (p = 0.019). We observed a correlation between nuclear Kaiso and membrane-localized E-cadherin and p120-catenin (p120) (p < 0.01). In contrast, cytoplasmic p120 strongly correlated with loss of E-cadherin and low nuclear Kaiso (p = 0.005). We could confirm these findings in human ILC cells and cell lines derived from conditional mouse models of ILC. Moreover, we present functional data that substantiate a mechanism whereby E-cadherin controls p120-mediated relief of Kaiso-dependent gene repression. In conclusion, our data indicate that nuclear Kaiso is common in clinically aggressive ductal breast cancer, while cytoplasmic Kaiso and a p120-mediated relief of Kaiso-dependent transcriptional repression characterize ILC.

Mastitis/ breast abscess can lead to intense inflammatory response; however, its association with epithelial hyperplasia is rarely reported. At times, it may be difficult to differentiate dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We present a case of periductal mastitis associated with epithelial hyperplasia, presenting as a subaerolar swelling in a male breast, which was misinterpreted as lobular carcinoma on FNAC. Diagn.

Breast		2012	APR 2012	21	2	159-164	159	164							The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of image-guided 14-gauge :leedle core biopsy in the diagnosis of radial scar without associated atypical epithelial proliferation, by comparison with definitive histological diagnosis on surgical excision. The records of 8792 consecutive image-guided 14-gauge needle core biopsy of the breast performed from January 1996 to December 2009 were reviewed. Forty-nine cases of radial scar without associated atypical epithelial proliferation were identified and compared with definitive histological diagnosis on surgical excision.The definitive histological diagnosis on surgical excision confirmed the results of image-guided 14-gauge needle core biopsy in 36 of 49 cases (73.5%), in 9 cases (18.3%) radial scar was associated with atypical epithelial proliferation, while 4 cases out of 49 cases were upgraded to carcinoma (3 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ and one case of invasive lobular carcinoma), with an underestimation rate of 8.2%.A diagnosis of radial scar without associated atypical epithelial proliferation m image-guided 14-gauge needle core biopsy does not exclude a malignancy on surgical excision: consequently during the multidisciplinary discussion further assessment by surgical excision or vacuum-assisted excision, as recently reported, needs to be considered to obtain a definitive histological diagnosis.

J	BCI:BCI201200315893	22431319			Tumor type and single-cell/mesothelial-like cell pattern of breast carcinoma metastases in pleural and peritoneal effusions		Antic, Tatjana; Gong, Yun; Sneige, Nour (nsneige@mdanderson.org)									Diagnostic Cytopathology		2012	APR 2012	40	4	311-315	311	315							Invasive ductal and lobular breast carcinomas often have different preferred metastasis sites and distinct histomorphologic characteristics. Their metastatic cytomorphologic cell features in body cavity fluids are generally readily recognized, but the single-cell/mesothelial-like pattern and its relationship to the primary tumor type have not been well studied, nor whether metastases have a propensity for certain body cavity sites on the basis of the primary tumor type. To further assess the tumor type and single-cell pattern of breast carcinoma metastases in pleural and peritoneal effusions, we retrospectively studied 853 pleural and peritoneal effusions and correlated the findings with the primary tumor type. When necessary, the single- cell/mesothelial-like pattern was documented immunohistochemically. Metastatic breast carcinomas represented 249 (50.8%) of 490 pleural and 51 (14.0%) of 363 peritoneal effusions. Most metastases in pleural and peritoneal effusions were ductal carcinomas (92.4% and 62.7%, respectively). Lobular carcinoma accounted for only 2 (0.8%) of 249 pleural and 11 (21.6%) of 51 peritoneal effusions. The single-cell/mesothelial-like cell pattern was found in all lobular carcinomas but also in 11 (6.0%) of 184 reviewed ductal carcinomas (nine pleural and two peritoneal). Awareness of these findings and the use of immunohistochemical analyses are necessary for accurately diagnosing metastatic breast carcinoma, especially lobular type. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2010.

We compared the characteristics and prognosis of bilateral breast cancer and unilateral breast cancer.Our study included 4,183 patients with breast cancer who were treated at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2007. Bilateral breast cancer was categorized as synchronous (within 3 months) or metachronous (diagnosed after 3 months of first cancer). SPSS was used for data analysis.106 (2.5%) and 31 (0.7%) patients were diagnosed with metachronous and synchronous bilateral cancer. Women with bilateral cancer had more frequent postmenopause, HER-2 negativity, and advanced disease than in patients with unilateral cancer. Young age at diagnosis, invasive lobular carcinoma, ER/PR negativity, HER-2 positivity, radiation, large tumor size (T > 5 cm), and stage III disease of the first cancer were risk factors for contralateral cancer. The 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 76 and 83% for unilateral cancer, while 32 and 72% for bilateral cancer (P = 0.000 for both).Bilateral cancer was associated with shorter disease-free survival and overall survival than unilateral cancer. The prognosis of metachronous bilateral cancer, especially those diagnosed within 2 years after the first cancer was significantly worse than synchronous bilateral cancer.														0171-5216	1432-1335	10.1007/s00432-011-1141-7																		
J	BCI:BCI201200308652	22245916			Clinical significance of miR-155 expression in breast cancer and effects of miR-155 ASO on cell viability and apoptosis		Zheng, Shu-Rong; Guo, Gui-Long (guoguilong@sina.com) ; Zhang, Wei; Huang, Guan-Li; Hu, Xiao-Qu; Zhu, Jin; Huang, Qi-Di; You, Jie; Zhang, Xiao-Hua									Oncology Reports		2012	APR 2012	27	4	1149-1155	1149	1155							Accumulating evidence shows that mircroRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in tumorigenesis. miR-155 is one of the most multifunctional miRNAs whose overexpression has been found to be associated with different types of cancer including breast cancer. To further determine the potential involvement of miR-155 in breast cancer, we evaluated the expression levels of miR-155 by real-time PCR and correlated the results with clinicopathological features. Matched non-tumor and tumor tissues of 42 infiltrating ductal carcinomas and 3 infiltrating lobular carcinomas were analyzed for miR-155 expression by real-time PCR. Further, we used an antisense technique to inhibit miR-155 expression in vitro. WST-8 test was performed to evaluate cell viability and apoptosis assay was used to investigate the effect of the miR-155 antisense oligonucleotide (miR-155 ASO) on HS578T cell death. The expression levels of miR-155 were significantly higher in tumor tissues than the levels in matched non-tumor tissues (P<0.001). Up-regulated miR-155 expression was associated with lymph node positivity (P=0.034), higher proliferation index (Ki-67 >10%) (P=0.019) and advanced breast cancer TNM clinical stage (P=0.002). Interestingly, we next found that miR-155 expression levels had close relations with ER status (P=0.041) and PR status (P=0.029). Transfection efficiency detected by flow cytometry was higher than 70%, the WST-8 test showed that viability of HS578T cells was greatly reduced after transfection with miR-155 ASO compared with the scramble (SCR) group or the liposome group. The Annexin V-FITC/PI assay also indicated that transfection with miR-155 ASO promoted apoptosis.														1021-335X	1791-2431	10.3892/or.2012.1634

A clinicopathologic analysis		St Romain, Paul; Madan, Rashna; Tawfik, Ossama W.; Damjanov, Ivan; Fan, Fang (ffan@kumc.edu)									Human Pathology		2012	MAR 2012	43	3	398-404	398	404							Prior studies have suggested that the type of breast cancer influences the location of distant metastases ("organotropism") and that there may be discordance of estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) expression between primaries and metastases. Our aims were to investigate the relationship between tumor type and metastatic site and to compare biomarker expression between primary and metastatic tumors. We retrospectively reviewed 102 biopsy-proven cases of breast cancer metastatic to distant sites from 2000 to 2010 and 34 corresponding primaries for histologic subtype, grade, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, and expression of estrogen receptor and Her2. Most metastases were of ductal (88) and lobular (11) histologic types. Available data on primaries indicated that the majority were grade III with positive lymph node metastasis and lymphovascular invasion. Biomarkers on 73 metastases showed 37 estrogen receptor positive/Her2-, 6 estrogen receptor positive/Her2+, 8 estrogen receptor negative/Her2+, and 22 estrogen receptor negative/Her2-. The most common metastatic sites were the lung (26%), bone (32%), and liver (21%). We found no association between estrogen receptor/Her2 profile and metastatic site (P = .16). When compared with ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma showed a unique metastatic pattern to gastrointestinal tract/gynecologic sites (P = .014). Of 34 cases with paired prognostic markers for primary and metastatic sites, 7 (20%) demonstrated discordance in estrogen receptor-positive/Her2 profile between the primary and the metastasis. Because the estrogen receptor-positive/Her2 profile of metastatic breast cancer did not always match that of the primary tumor, it is important to repeat the prognostic markers of metastasis.

It is not known whether radiation-related breast cancer risk varies by molecular subtype. We characterized the relative risk (RR) of contralateral breast cancer (CBC) related to radiotherapy by histology and estrogen receptor (ER) status of the CBC in five-year survivors in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database using Poisson regression models adjusted for attained age and calendar year, age at and year of treatment, ER status of the first breast cancer, and disease stage. 205,316 female breast cancer survivors were followed for an average of 10 years from 1973 until 2007, during which time 6924 women developed a subsequent primary invasive breast cancer in the contralateral breast. The overall RR (and 95% confidence interval (CI)) of radiotherapy-related CBC was 1.11 (1.05-1.16). There was no heterogeneity in risk according to histology of the CBC (P > 0.50) for all ages or young age at exposure, but case numbers were small for subtypes other than ductal and lobular carcinomas. Information on ER status was available from 1990 onwards for 3546 CBC cases, of which 2597 (73%) were ER+ and 949 (27%) were ER-. The RRs were 1.10 (1.02-1.19) for ER+ CBC and 1.19 (1.04-1.35) for ER- CBC (P (difference) = 0.33). Among women treated age < 35 years, radiation-related risk of CBC was non-significantly elevated for ER- (RR = 1.38, 95% CI: 0.96-1.97) but not for ER+ tumors (RR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.47-1.35) (P (difference) = 0.09). We did not find clear evidence that radiation-related risk varies by histology or ER status, but our findings, which were the first to examine this question, were suggestive of possible differences by ER status that may merit further investigation.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-011-1820-8

Topoisomerase-IIa gene amplification was evaluated by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We also assessed Her2/neu status by CISH, FISH and silver in situ hybridization (SISH). HER2 immunoexpression was assessed by the HercepTest. Forty-four of 46 (95%) cases revealed no topoisomerase-II alpha amplification, whereas two of 46 (5%) cases were amplified by all three techniques. Eleven of the 13 metastatic sites showed no amplification either in the primary or in the metastases (85%); the remaining two were amplified (15%). Her2/neu was not amplified in 44 of 46 (95%) cases nor was it amplified in 11 of 13 (95%) metastatic tissues. The two cases showing Her2/neu and topoisomerase-IIa amplification scored 3+; the remaining non-amplified cases scored 0 or 1+ in 40 and 2+ in four cases.Conclusions: In the era of personalized and tailored therapies, we suggest that patients affected by the classical lobular subtype of breast carcinoma constantly lack the ad hoc predictive rationale for receiving common chemotherapy that includes anthracyclines.			manfrin, erminia/P-2645-2016; Nottegar, Alessia/Q-4921-2016	manfrin, erminia/0000-0002-5706-0018; Nottegar, Alessia/0000-0003-3325-8705; Gobbo, Stefano/0000-0001-5247-5233										0309-0167	1365-2559	10.1111/j.1365-2559.2011.04067.x

The aim of this study is to review the axillary LN FNAs performed at our institution prior to treatment, and to correlate their results with the available LN histology in order to evaluate the diagnostic utility of FNA. Study Design: A total of 130 cases were retrospectively identified over a 1-year period and reviewed. The FNA findings were correlated with the histological findings in 65 (50%) LN core biopsies, 43 (33%) sentinel LN biopsies, and 22 (17%) axillary dissections. Results: One hundred and thirteen FNA cases (89%) correlated with the histology, while 14 cases (11%) did not correlate, including 1 false positive and 13 false negatives. Of the false-negative cases, metastases in the biopsy ranged from isolated tumor cells to 5 mm in the greatest dimension. The overall sensitivity was 85%, specificity 98%, positive predictive value 99%, and negative predictive value 75%. Conclusion: Pretherapy staging of breast cancer by FNA is a useful diagnostic modality with a high specificity and positive predictive value. Due to false-negative diagnoses, a negative FNA should be followed up with further LN sampling. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

The aim of this study was to elucidate whether the intensity and location of calreticulin overexpression in tumor cells are related to the elevated humoral immunity to calreticulin in patients with benign or malignant breast disease. Methods: This study involved 27 patients with benign and 58 patients with malignant breast tumors before surgical resection and 38 healthy volunteers. Cytoplasmatic or membranous calreticulin overexpression in malignant or benign cells in paraffin-embedded tissues was determined using immunohistochemistry. Levels of the serum anti-calreticulin autoantibodies were detected by ELISA. Results: Statistically significant differences between serum levels of IgA of anti-calreticulin antibodies in controls and patients with breast tumors, and between controls and patients with nonmalignant breast diseases were found, but no statistically significant differences were found between levels of serum IgG anti-calreticulin antibodies. Humoral immunity to calreticulin developed against cytoplasmatic and co-localized membranous calreticulin was not correlated to the intensity of its overexpression and was present even in the absence of its membranous localization. Conclusions: The degree of calreticulin overexpression in lobular breast carcinoma is lower than in ductal breast carcinoma. Elevated concentrations of anti-calreticulin IgA antibodies were present more frequently in patients with metastasis in locoregional lymph nodes in comparison to anti-calreticulin IgG antibodies.

The purpose of this study is to illustrate the imaging and pathological features of LN and ILC. For lobular lesions, imaging is the basic and essential diagnostic tool, so the understanding and effective use of multimodality imaging findings are important. This article shows imaging findings of LN, which are seldom known, and ILC as well as their characteristic histopathological features.

Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent ST among young treated women.Material and methods: One hundred and eighty-nine women treated for HD by radiotherapy (RT) and/or chemotherapy (CT) subsequently developed 214 BCs.Results: Median age at HD diagnosis was 25 years (34% were less than 20). Median interval between HD and BC was 18.6 years, with a 42-year median age at first BC. According to the TNM classification, there were 30 (14%) To (non palbable lesions), 86 (40%) T-1, 56 (26%) T-2, 13 (6%) T3T4 and 29 (14%) T-x. There were 25 (13.2%) contralateral BC. 160 (75%) and 15 (7%) tumours were infiltrating ductal and lobular carcinomas, 7 (3.3%) were other subtypes and 27 (22%) DCIS.The rate of axillary nodal involvement was 32%. Among 203 operated tumours, 79 (39%) were treated by breast conserving surgery (BCS), with RT in 56 (71%) cases. CT and hormonal treatment were delivered in 51% and 45% of the patients. With a 50-month median follow-up, local recurrence occurred in 12% of the tumours (9% after mastectomy, 21% after lumpectomy alone and 13.7% after lumpectomy with RT). Metastasis occurred in 47 (26%) patients. The risk factors were pN+, pT, high SBR grade and young age (<50 years). The ten-year overall and specific survival rates were 53% and 63.5%, respectively. The ten-year specific survival rates were 79% for pT(0)T(1)T(2), 48% for pT(3)T(4) (p=0.0002) and 79% for pN(0) versus 38.5% for pN+ (p=0.00026). Among 67 deaths, 43 (73%) were due to BC.Conclusion: Patients and physicians should be aware that BC is the most frequent secondary tumour in young women treated for HD. The new RT modalities (lower doses and involved fields) may decrease the risk in the future. However, these women require a careful monitoring as from 8 to 10 years after HD treatment, combining mammography, ultrasound and MRI according to several ongoing studies.

A 76-year-old woman with a history of NF-1 who had undergone left modified mastectomy for breast cancer seven years previously was admitted to our hospital because of a right breast tumor and abdominal discomfort. Computed tomography revealed an enhanced irregular tumor in the right breast and peripheral enhanced tumors in the abdomen. The patient underwent right modified mastectomy and laparoscopic tumor resection combined with small intestine surgery. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of invasive lobular carcinoma in the right breast and GIST in the abdomen. The synchronous development of breast cancer and GIST in a patient with NF-1 is extremely rare, with this being the second case ever reported.														0250-7005	1791-7530

We examined the effectiveness of neoadjuvant letrozole in postmenopausal women (PMW) with estrogen receptor (ER)-rich ILC. PMW were considered for treatment with neoadjuvant letrozole if they had ER-rich, large operable, or locally advanced cancers, or were unfit for surgical therapy. Tumor volume was estimated at diagnosis and at 3 months using calipers (clinical), ultrasound, and mammography. At 3 months, if physically fit, women were assessed for surgery. Responsive women with cancers too large for breast-conserving surgery continued with letrozole. Patients had surgery or were switched to alternative therapy if tumor volume was increasing. Sixty-one patients (mean age, 76.2 years) with 63 ILCs were treated with letrozole for a parts per thousand yen3 months. The mean reduction in tumor volume at 3 months was 66% (median, 76%) measured clinically, 61% (median, 73%) measured by ultrasound, and 54% (median, 60%) measured by mammography. Surgery was possible at 3 months in 24 cancers in 24 patients, and all but two of the remaining patients continued with letrozole therapy for a median duration of 9 months. At the time of this publication, 40 patients with a total of 41 cancers have undergone surgery. The rate of successful breast conservation was 81% (25/31). Twenty-one patients have continued with letrozole monotherapy, and 19 remain controlled on letrozole at a median of 2.8 years. There is a high rate of response to letrozole in PMW with ER-rich ILC.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-011-1735-4																		
J	BCI:BCI201200695571	21664064			POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PREOPERATIVE MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING OF THE BREAST ON PATIENT SELECTION FOR ACCELERATED PARTIAL BREAST IRRADIATION		Kuehr, Marietta (marietta.kuehr@ukb.uni-bonn.de) ; Wolfgarten, Matthias; Stoelzle, Marco; Leutner, Claudia; Hoeller, Tobias; Schrading, Simone; Kuhl, Christiane; Schild, Hans; Kuhn, Walther; Braun, Michael									International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics		2011	NOV 15 2011	81	4	E541-E546	E541	E546							Purpose: Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) after breast-conserving therapy is currently under investigation in prospective randomized studies. Multifocality and multicentricity are exclusion criteria for APBI. Preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect ipsilateral and contralateral invasive tumor foci or ductal carcinoma in situ in addition to conventional diagnostic methods (clinical examination, mammography, and ultrasonography). The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative MRI on patient selection for APBI.Methods and Materials: From 2002 to 2007, a total of 579 consecutive, nonselected patients with newly diagnosed early-stage breast cancer received preoperative breast MRI in addition to conventional imaging studies at the Bonn University Breast Cancer Center. In retrospect, 113 patients would have met the criteria for APBI using conventional imaging workup (clinical tumor size <= 3 cm; negative axillary lymph node status; unifocal disease; no evidence of distant metastases; no invasive lobular carcinoma, ductal and lobular carcinoma in situ, or Paget's disease). We analyzed the amount of additional ipsilateral and contralateral tumor foci detected by MRI.Results: MRI detected additional tumor foci in 8.8% of patients eligible for APBI (11 tumor foci in 10 of 113 patients), either ipsilateral (n = 7, 6.2%) or contralateral (n = 4, 3.5%). In 1 patient, MRI helped detect additional tumor focus both ipsilaterally and contralaterally.Conclusions: Preoperative breast MRI is able to identify additional tumor foci in a clinically relevant number of cases in this highly selected group of patients with low-risk disease and may be useful in selecting patients for APBI.

Clinical, pathologic, and treatment related variables were analyzed including age, tumor size, hormone receptor status, surgical margins, lymph node status, adjuvant hormonal therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and APBI modality. Clinical outcomes including local recurrence (LR), regional recurrence (RR), disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.Results: Median follow-up was 3.8 years for the ILC patients and 6.0 years for the IDC patients. ILC patients were more likely to have positive margins (20.0% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.006), larger tumors (14.1 mm vs. 10.9 mm, p = 0.03) and less likely to be node positive (0% vs. 9.5%, p < 0.001) when compared with patients diagnosed with IDC. The 5-year rate of LR was 0% for the ILC cohort and 2.5% for the IDC cohort (p = 0.59). No differences were seen in the rates of RR (0% vs. 0.7%, p = 0.80), distant metastases (0% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.54), DFS (100% vs. 94%, p = 0.43), CSS (100% vs. 97%, p = 0.59), or OS (92% vs. 89%, p = 0.88) between the ILC and IDC patients, respectively. Additionally, when node-positive patients were excluded from the IDC cohort, no differences in the rates of LR (0% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.62), RR (0% vs. 0%), DFS (100% vs. 95%, p = 0.46), CSS (100% vs. 98%, p = 0.63), or OS (92% vs. 89%, p = 0.91) were noted between the ILC and IDC patients.Conclusion: Women with ILC had excellent clinical outcomes after APBI. No difference in local control was seen between patients with invasive lobular versus invasive ductal histology.

J	BCI:BCI201200253569	22322849			Obstructive colon metastases from lobular breast cancer: report of a case and review of the literature		Mistrangelo, Massimiliano (mistrangelo@katamail.com) ; Cassoni, Paola; Mistrangelo, Marinella; Castellano, Isabella; Codognotto, Elena; Sapino, Anna; Lamanna, Ginevra; Cravero, Francesca; Bianco, Lavinia; Fora, Gianluca; Sandrucci, Sergio									Tumori		2011	NOV-DEC 2011	97	6	800-804	800	804							Introduction. Gastrointestinal metastases from breast cancer are rare. One large series reported a rate of 0.7% of gastrointestinal metastatic manifestations from breast cancer, but its true incidence could be underestimated. Here we report a case of bowel obstruction caused by sigmoid metastases from breast cancer and describe its relevance to histological origin and clinical practice.Methods. The clinical course and histopathology of the case are reviewed and compared with reports of similar cases in the literature.Results. An 80-year-old woman presented with bowel obstruction. Her medical history included infiltrating lobular breast cancer treated with left radical mastectomy 25 years before the current presentation; 13 years later bone metastases developed and were treated with hormone therapy. In 2003 the patient came to our emergency department because of symptoms of bowel obstruction. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass in the distal sigmoid causing the obstruction. A colostomy was performed, followed by a second operation completed with Hartmann's procedure. Histological examination revealed metastases from invasive lobular carcinoma. The patient was discharged 45 days postoperatively and died 9 months later because of disease progression.Conclusions. Although gastrointestinal metastases from breast cancer are rare, patients with diagnosed breast cancer, particularly invasive lobular carcinoma, should be regularly followed up with endoscopy, CT, endosonography and PET-CT when abdominal symptoms are present. This could permit early diagnosis of gastrointestinal metastases and improve treatment planning.

J	BCI:BCI201100720655	22031313			Quantifying the Extent of Invasive Carcinoma and Margin Status in Partial Mastectomy Cases Having a Gross Lesion Is a Defined Tissue Processing Protocol Needed?		Sneed, George M.; Duncan, Lisa D.									American Journal of Clinical Pathology		2011	NOV 2011	136	5	747-753	747	753							Accurate estimation of disease extent and margin status is critical when evaluating partial mastectomy cases because both are predictors of recurrence. No published standards exist for processing specimens involved by invasive carcinoma, presumably because such cases have a gross lesion. We retrospectively studied 100 partial mastectomy cases and concluded that a standardized tissue mapping protocol is needed to ensure adequate pathologic examination even when a gross lesion is present. When mapped and unmapped findings were compared, 17 cases (10 with ductal and 7 with lobular carcinoma) had an increase in carcinoma size, 12 cases (9 with ductal and 3 with lobular carcinoma) had an increase in pathologic T stage, and positive margins were found in 8 cases (7 with ductal and 1 with lobular carcinoma). We describe our tissue-mapping protocol, and advocate its use as a standardized protocol for processing all partial mastectomy specimens.														0002-9173	1943-7722	10.1309/AJCPY4MI1RCWPTVR																		
J	BCI:BCI201400686766	21712309			Lymph-node metastases in invasive lobular carcinoma are different from those in ductal carcinoma of the breast		Fernandez, Beatriz; Paish, E.

(emadrakha@yahoo.com)									Journal of Clinical Pathology (London)		2011	NOV 2011	64	11	995-1000	995	1000							Aim Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast are distinct morphological entities with different biological features and clinical behaviour. In the present study, the authors compare the axillary-lymph-node (ALN) status of patients with grade-matched ILC (no=426) and IDC (no=820). The pattern of nodal metastatic deposits (nodular, sinusoidal and diffuse) and the proportion of involved nodes were also analysed in a selected group of 246 tumours, which were associated with a single positive ALN.Results Compared with grade-matched IDC, ILC was associated with a higher nodal stage (13.1% vs 4.5% of ILC and IDC were stage 3), higher absolute number of positive nodes and higher ratio of positive nodes (0.46+/-0.30 and 0.33+/-0.23 in ILC and IDC respectively). These differences were maintained in the different size subgroups. The most common metastatic morphological pattern was nodular in both types of carcinomas. A sinusoidal pattern was more frequent in IDC, and the diffuse pattern was more frequent in ILC. Despite these differences, ILC and grade-matched IDC exhibited similar rates of regional recurrences (RR) and breast-cancer survival.Conclusion This study provides clinical evidence which further demonstrates that ILC and IDC are biologically distinct entities with different lymph-node involvement patterns and ILC having a tendency to metastasise to more nodes than IDC. However, this difference was not associated with a significant impact on patient outcome.

The histological subtype of primary breast cancer was invasive lobular carcinoma in 34 patients (97%). Hormonal receptors were positive in 19 out of 24 cases (79%), two out of 22 analysed were HER2 positive (9%). There were 16 (46%) patients with peritoneal carcinosis. The treatment was chemotherapy (n=13, 37%), hormonotherapy (n=2, 6%) or both (n = 13, 37%). The 2-year survival rate after gastric metastasis diagnosis was 53% with a median follow up of 31 months [7-84 months].Conclusion: Ninety-seven percent of gastric metastasis from breast cancers are derived from invasive lobular carcinoma. Seventy-nine percent of these are HER+ and comparison with the original histopathological slides of primary breast carcinoma should be performed to differentiate gastric metastasis from primary gastric carcinoma. Peritoneal carcinomatosis accompanied gastric metastasis in almost half the cases in this series and treatment was generally chemotherapy. (C) 2011 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

J	BCI:BCI201100630994	21297444			Differential Expression of Transferrin Receptor (TfR) in a Spectrum of Normal to Malignant Breast Tissues: Implications for In Situ and Invasive Carcinoma		Singh, Meenakshi (meenakshi.singh@stonybrook.edu) ; Mugler, Kimberly; Hailoo, Dulan W.; Burke, Stephanie; Nemesure, Barbara; Torkko, Kathleen; Shroyer, Kenneth R.									Applied Immunohistochemistry & Molecular Morphology		2011	OCT 2011	19	5	417-423	417	423							Transferrin receptor (TfR), a type II transmembranous receptor involved in iron uptake, is highly expressed in some cancers. We evaluated the expression of TfR in a spectrum of normal to malignant breast tissues to test the hypothesis that overexpression is associated with malignant transformation. Expression of TfR was studied by immunohistochemistry (CD71-Antibody, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA) for percent positive cells (%) and intensity of staining (0 to 3 score) in normal (n = 127), benign (n = 172), potentially premalignant and in-situ carcinoma (n = 65), and invasive carcinoma (n = 38). Normal and benign lesions had significantly lower TfR expression compared with premalignant lesions (atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma in situ) and invasive carcinoma (median %: 0, 10, 50, and 80, respectively; P < 0.0001). TfR expression was higher in high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) than in other grades of DCIS (median %: 95 vs 55; P = 0.02) and in high-grade invasive carcinoma. Among the latter, medullary carcinoma had the highest expression and there was a trend for invasive lobular carcinoma to have a higher expression than invasive ductal carcinoma. In invasive carcinoma cases, the proportion (%) of cells staining for TfR was inversely correlated with the percentage of estrogen receptor-positive cells, with a decreasing slope on linear regression models. In comparison, the relationship with progesterone receptor was not as well defined and linear regression models revealed close to a flat line. These data show that there is a differential expression of TfR in breast tissues with the highest expression in in-situ and invasive carcinoma and with aggressive phenotypes (higher grade DCIS and lower estrogen receptor positivity in invasive carcinomas). Further studies are indicated to determine whether TfR is an independently significant prognostic marker that may have potential as a therapeutic target in in-situ and invasive breast carcinoma.														1541-2016	1533-4058	10.1097/PAI.0b013e318209716e																		
J	BCI:BCI201300052322	22015285			Adjuvant therapies for special types of breast cancer		Colleoni, Marco (marco.colleoni@ieo.it) ; Russo, Leila; Dellapasqua, Silvia									Breast		2011	OCT 2011	20	Suppl. 3	S153-S157	S153	S157							Recent developments in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer include an increasing attention to systemic therapies prescribed in homogeneous groups of patients according to the higher chance of benefit. A clear consequence of the current adjuvant treatment strategy is the importance of accurate and reliable histopathological assessment. A proper pathological evaluation may effectively support the definition of prognosis and treatment choice in niches of patients diagnosed with special types of breast cancer. Through the identification of special types of breast cancer, that account for up to 25% of all invasive breast carcinomas, it is possible to select patients with a very good prognosis often close to that of the general population ( e. g. tubular and pure cribriform carcinoma). Other features, such as those related with invasive classical lobular carcinoma, might have important correlates of responsiveness to therapy other than indicators of outcome. It was in fact demonstrated that the response to primary chemotherapy is significantly lower in invasive lobular carcinoma, if compared with the ductal histotype. However, the use of available information on special types of breast cancer has been limited in tailoring adjuvant therapy, owing to the absence of standardized criteria and partial reproducibility for diagnosis. Moreover, due to the relative rarity of the disease a large number of features that identify for special types of breast carcinomas have today no particular correlation with the prognosis, and limited data are available on the biology of a large number of breast cancer subtypes. The development of more effective therapies for patients with special types of breast cancer requires tailored treatment investigations through international cooperation and should not rely on information predominantly contributed from small retrospective analyses. Examination of patterns of relapse and treatment response within subpopulations in multiple randomized trials is also mandatory to make progress and reach consensus on how to treat individual patients with special types of breast cancer.

A previous report has described the high rate of coexistent ductal carcinoma in situ in PLH/CHH; however, a PLH/CHH study involving a larger number of cases is necessary to unravel the clinical significance of this tumor type. Case Report: We describe a unique case of PLH/CHH that coexisted with multifocal lobular neoplasm. Multifocal invasive lobular carcinoma with lobular carcinoma in situ was observed to be adjacent to the PLH/CHH cystic lesions in the left breast of a 70-year-old woman. Conclusions: The present case documents the previously unreported coexistence of PLH/CHH accompanied by multifocal lobular carcinoma. Extensive examination, including an excisional biopsy, is prudent if a needle core biopsy reveals a PLH/CHH lesion.														0378-584X	1423-0240	10.1159/000331126

Breast carcinoma cases were comprised of 81 invasive ductal carcinoma NOS, 9 invasive lobular carcinoma, 1 apocrine carcinoma, 2 cribriform carcinoma, 2 papillary carcinoma and 5 mucinous carcinoma. Control biopsies consisted of 13 fibroadenoma, 9 benign epithelial proliferation (adenosis and sclerosing adenosis), 9 usual ductal hyperplasia, 4 atypical ductal hyperplasia, 4 non-proliferative fibrocystic changes and 3 normal breast tissue. To identify EBV-infected cells we applied immunohistochemical analysis, using monoclonal antibody against Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1). Further, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify EBV DNA, with primers that cover the EBV encoded RNA (EBER) and BamHIW regions. EBNA-2 and LMP-1 immunohistochemistry were negative in all breast cancer and control specimens. Using PCR, none of the 100 breast cancer samples or the 42 control specimens showed detectable EBV DNA. These results indicate that EBV may not play a significant role in the etiology of breast cancer in Iranian women.														1219-4956	1532-2807	10.1007/s12253-010-9325-z

(pderksen@umcutrecht.nl)									Journal of Clinical Investigation		2011	AUG 2011	121	8	3176-3188	3176	3188							Metastatic breast cancer is the major cause of cancer-related death among women in the Western world. Invasive carcinoma cells are able to counteract apoptotic signals in the absence of anchorage, enabling cell survival during invasion and dissemination. Although loss of E-cadherin is a cardinal event in the development and progression of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), little is known about the underlying mechanisms that govern these processes. Using a mouse model of human ILC, we show here that cytosolic p120-catenin (p120) regulates tumor growth upon loss of E-cadherin through the induction of anoikis resistance. p120 conferred anchorage independence by indirect activation of Rho/Rock signaling through interaction and inhibition of myosin phosphatase Rho-interacting protein (Mrip), an antagonist of Rho/Rock function. Consistent with these data, primary human ILC samples expressed hallmarks of active Rock signaling, and Rock controlled the anoilcis resistance of human ILC cells. Thus, we have linked loss of E-cadherin an initiating event in ILC development - to Rho/Rock-mediated control of anchorage-independent survival. Because activation of Rho and Rock are strongly linked to cancer progression and are susceptible to pharmacological inhibition, these insights may have clinical implications for the development of tailor-made intervention strategies to better treat invasive and metastatic lobular breast cancer.

We therefore evaluated the diagnostic performance of SWE for the differentiation of breast masses compared with conventional ultrasound (US). Conventional US and SWE were performed by three experienced radiologists for 158 consecutive women who had been scheduled for US-guided core biopsy or surgical excision in 182 breast masses (89 malignancies and 93 benign; mean size, 1.76 cm). For each lesion, quantitative elasticity was measured in terms of the Young's modulus (in kilopascals, kPa) with SWE, and BI-RADS final categories were assessed with conventional US. The mean elasticity values were significantly higher in malignant masses (153.3 kPa +/- A 58.1) than in benign masses (46.1 kPa +/- A 42.9), (P < 0.0001). The average mean elasticity values of invasive ductal (157.5 +/- A 57.07) or invasive lobular (169.5 +/- A 61.06) carcinomas were higher than those of ductal carcinoma in situ (117.8 kPa +/- A 54.72). The average mean value was 49.58 +/- A 43.51 for fibroadenoma, 35.3 +/- A 31.2 for fibrocystic changes, 69.5 +/- A 63.2 for intraductal papilloma, and 149.5 +/- A 132.4 for adenosis or stromal fibrosis. The optimal cut-off value, yielding the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, was 80.17 kPa, and the sensitivity and specificity of SWE were 88.8% (79 of 89) and 84.9% (79 of 93). The area under the ROC curve (Az value) was 0.898 for conventional US, 0.932 for SWE, and 0.982 for combined data. In conclusion, there were significant differences in the elasticity values of benign and malignant masses as well as invasive and intraductal cancers with SWE. Our results suggest that SWE has the potential to aid in the differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions.

Its occurrence with apocrine lobular carcinoma in situ and consistent expression of gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 suggest apocrine differentiation. Its recognition is often challenging, particularly when histiocytoid tumour cells occur in a metastatic site before the primary diagnosis of breast carcinoma, or in limited core biopsy or cytology material. In the breast, its bland histological appearances can lead to a benign diagnosis. Clues to the correct conclusion include finding tumour cells with more cytological atypia, the presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles and secretions, coexistence with more traditional invasive lobular carcinoma patterns and/or lobular neoplasia, and the use of immuohistochemistry to confirm their epithelial nature. Close clinicoradiological correlation and awareness of histological mimics are needed to achieve an accurate diagnosis of this enigmatic condition that should be appropriately subsumed within the invasive lobular histological subtype.														0021-9746	1472-4146	10.1136/jcp.2011.088930

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2011	AUG 2011	128	3	749-753	749	753							Breast reduction is a common surgical procedure performed by plastic and oncoplastic breast surgeons. The authors report on the incidence and management of cancer and atypical hyperplasia in breast reduction specimens from one institution over a 10-year period. All patients who underwent breast reduction surgery at Northern General Hospital, Sheffield were identified from an electronic prospective database. The histopathology reports were analyzed. Case records of all patients with significant abnormalities were retrieved and examined to identify their management and follow-up. Between October 1999 and April 2010, 1,588 patients underwent breast reduction. Nine specimens showed atypical hyperplasia (0.57%). Five cancers were detected (0.31%). Four of the five patients had normal screening mammograms 1-3 years before the reduction operation. Of these cancers, four were invasive (three lobular, one ductal) (0.25%) and one was DCIS (0.06%). A lump was felt macroscopically by the pathologist in two of the four patients with invasive cancer. The patients with DCIS did not undergo further surgery, whereas those with invasive disease underwent mastectomy (three patients) and axillary nodal staging (four patients). None of the patients with normal post-reduction breast imaging had residual cancer on histology. The incidence of occult carcinoma in breast reduction specimens is low. Patients should be counseled with regards to the possible consequences preoperatively.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-011-1589-9

(gmc24@columbia.edu) ; Garrido, Fernando									International Journal of Oncology		2011	JUL 2011	39	1	177-183	177	183							The origin of human tumors has been attributed to the exposure to several environmental chemicals and implicated in the increase of incidence in breast cancer. Progression of breast cancer follows a complex multistep process that seems to depend on various exogenous and endogenous factors. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the organophosphorous pesticide malathion in the presence of estrogen on neoplastic transformation of rat mammary glands. Virgin female rats were sacrificed after 30, 124 and 240 days of 5-day injections twice a day. There were four groups: i) control, ii) malathion (22 mg/100 g body weight, BW), iii) 17 beta-estradiol (30 mu g/100 g BW) and iv) combination of both. Progressive alterations in ducts were observed by the effect of malathion in comparison to control after 240 days. Ducts markedly increased in size and number of cells per square millimeter and tumors similar to ductal carcinoma were originated. The increase in number of proliferative ducts per square millimeter was significantly (P<0.05) higher in malathion-treated animals compared to the other groups. Progressive alterations in lobules with estrogen treatment were found after 240 days. Lobules became markedly abnormal, referred to as secretory lobules, increased in number and size and the tumors originated were similar to lobular carcinoma. The increase in number of secretory lobules was significantly (P<0.05) higher in estrogen-treated animals compared to the other groups. Treatment with the combination of malathion and estrogen gave rise to tumors constituted of both proliferative ducts and secretory lobules as well as formation of estrogen metabolites such as 2 and 4 catechol estrogens in the blood of the animals after 240 days. We concluded that morphological changes and alterations in the blood of the animals can be used as biomarkers for mammary gland cancer.														1019-6439	1791-2423	10.3892/ijo.2011.1008

Aromatase inhibitors prevent more contralateral breast cancers and cause fewer side effects than tamoxifen in patients with early-stage breast cancer.MethodsIn a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of exemestane designed to detect a 65% relative reduction in invasive breast cancer, eligible postmenopausal women 35 years of age or older had at least one of the following risk factors: 60 years of age or older; Gail 5-year risk score greater than 1.66% (chances in 100 of invasive breast cancer developing within 5 years); prior atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ; or ductal carcinoma in situ with mastectomy. Toxic effects and health-related and menopause-specific qualities of life were measured.ResultsA total of 4560 women for whom the median age was 62.5 years and the median Gail risk score was 2.3% were randomly assigned to either exemestane or placebo. At a median follow-up of 35 months, 11 invasive breast cancers were detected in those given exemestane and in 32 of those given placebo, with a 65% relative reduction in the annual incidence of invasive breast cancer (0.19% vs. 0.55%; hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.70; P = 0.002). The annual incidence of invasive plus noninvasive (ductal carcinoma in situ) breast cancers was 0.35% on exemestane and 0.77% on placebo (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.79; P = 0.004). Adverse events occurred in 88% of the exemestane group and 85% of the placebo group (P = 0.003), with no significant differences between the two groups in terms of skeletal fractures, cardiovascular events, other cancers, or treatment-related deaths. Minimal quality-of-life differences were observed.ConclusionsExemestane significantly reduced invasive breast cancers in postmenopausal women who were at moderately increased risk for breast cancer. During a median follow-up period of 3 years, exemestane was associated with no serious toxic effects and only minimal changes in health-related quality of life.

METHODS: In total, 1044 SLN samples from 496 patients at 11 clinical sites were analyzed. Alternate 1-mm sections were subjected to either detailed histopathologic evaluation with hematoxylin and eosin and pancytokeratin immunostaining or the OSNA Breast Cancer System, which was calibrated to detect tumor deposits >0.2 mm by measuring cytokeratin 19 messenger RNA. At 7 sites, IC was performed before permanent section. The OSNA results were classified as negative (<250 copies/mu L), micrometastases (from >= 250 to <5000 copies/mu L), or macrometastases (>= 5000 copies/mu L). RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the OSNA breast cancer system compared with reference pathology were 77.5% (95% confidence interval, 69.7%-84.2%) and 95.8% (95% confidence interval, 94.3%-97.0%), respectively, before discordant case analyses (DCA). Sensitivity and specificity after DCA were 82.7% and 97.7%, and final concordance was 95.8%. Performance for invasive lobular carcinoma demonstrated 88.2% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 63.6%-98.5%) and 98.5% specificity (95% confidence interval, 92%-100%). The sensitivity of OSNA was significantly better than that of IC (80% vs 63%; P=.0229). CONCLUSIONS: The OSNA breast cancer system proved to be highly accurate for the detection of metastatic breast cancer in axillary SLNs. Sensitivity was comparable to that predicted for conventional postoperative histologic examination at 2-mm intervals and was significantly more sensitive than IC. Automation, semiquantitative results enabling the differentiation of macrometastasis and micrometastasis, and rapid results render the assay suitable for intraoperative and/or permanent evaluation of SLNs.

We aimed to validate this approach and investigate the utility of a D2-40 antibody.Methods: A series of 80 MPM patients selected for surgery and 21 consecutive patients with pleural metastatic carcinoma were included. A minimal panel of antibodies, consisting of calretinin, BG8 and CD15, and D2-40 was investigated.Results: There were 61 epithelial and 19 biphasic MPM as well as 12 metastatic lung, six breast (5 ductal adenocarcinomas, 1 mixed ductal/lobular adenocarcinoma), two serous papillary ovarian carcinomas and one moderately differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma. The sensitivity of positive calretinin labelling to confirm the diagnosis of MPM was 97.5%, while the 'diagnostic sensitivities' of lack of labelling for BG8 and CD15 were 91.3% and 97.5%, respectively. The use of calretinin, BG8 and CD15 resulted in correct classification in 97.5% of all MPMs. All MPM cases investigated showed at least focal positive D2-40 labelling.Conclusions: We have validated the usefulness of a minimal panel of antibodies with calretinin, BG8 and CD15 as the initial step to the diagnosis of MPM. D2-40 emerged as a helpful diagnostic tool for cases where our initial approach failed to conclusively diagnose MPM.			van Zandwijk, Nico/E-4177-2012	van Zandwijk, Nico/0000-0002-8405-9688; Vardy, Janette/0000-0002-5739-5790										0031-3025		10.1097/PAT.0b013e32834642da

(p.w.b.derksen@umcutrecht.nl) ; Braumuller, Tanya M.; van der Burg, Eline; Hornsveld, Marten; Mesman, Elly; Wesseling, Jelle; Krimpenfort, Paul; Jonkers, Jos (j.jonkers@nki.nl)									Disease Models & Mechanisms		2011	MAY 2011	4	3	347-358	347	358							Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women of the Western world. Even though a large percentage of breast cancer patients show pathological complete remission after standard treatment regimes, approximately 30-40% are non-responsive and ultimately develop metastatic disease. To generate a good preclinical model of invasive breast cancer, we have taken a tissue-specific approach to somatically inactivate p53 and E-cadherin, the cardinal cell-cell adhesion receptor that is strongly associated with tumor invasiveness. In breast cancer, E-cadherin is found mutated or otherwise functionally silenced in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), which accounts for 10-15% of all breast cancers. We show that mammary-specific stochastic inactivation of conditional E-cadherin and p53 results in impaired mammary gland function during pregnancy through the induction of anoikis resistance of mammary epithelium, resulting in loss of epithelial organization and a dysfunctional mammary gland. Moreover, combined inactivation of E-cadherin and p53 induced lactation-independent development of invasive and metastatic mammary carcinomas, which showed strong resemblance to human pleomorphic ILC. Dissemination patterns of mouse ILC mimic the human malignancy, showing metastasis to the gastrointestinal tract, peritoneum, lung, lymph nodes and bone. Our results confirm that loss of E-cadherin contributes to both mammary tumor initiation and metastasis, and establish a preclinical mouse model of human ILC that can be used for the development of novel intervention strategies to treat invasive breast cancer.

(pnewcomb@fhcrc.org) ; Trentham-Dietz, Amy; Hampton, John M.; Egan, Kathleen M.; Titus-Ernstoff, Linda; Andersen, Shaneda Warren; Greenberg, E. Robert; Willett, Walter C.									Cancer		2011	MAY 1 2011	117	9	1946-1956	1946	1956							BACKGROUND: Late age at first full-term birth and nulliparity are known to increase breast cancer risk. The frequency of these risk factors has increased in recent decades. METHODS: The purpose of this population-based case-control study was to examine associations between parity, age at first birth (AFB), and specific histological subtypes of breast cancer. Women with breast cancer were identified from cancer registries in Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Control subjects were randomly selected from population lists. Interviews collected information on reproductive histories and other risk factors. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of ductal, lobular, and mixed ductal-lobular breast cancer diagnosis in association with AFB and nulliparity. RESULTS: AFB >= 30 years was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in risk of lobular breast cancer compared with AFB < 20 years (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.9-2.9). The association was less pronounced for ductal breast cancer (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4). Nulliparity was associated with increased risk for all breast cancer subtypes, compared with women with AFB < 20 years, but the association was stronger for lobular (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.2) than for ductal (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3) subtypes (P = .004). The adverse effects of later AFB was stronger with obesity (P = .03) in lobular, but not ductal, breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Stronger associations observed for late AFB and nulliparity suggest that these factors preferentially stimulate growth of lobular breast carcinomas. Recent temporal changes in reproductive patterns and rates of obesity may impact the histological presentation of breast cancer. Cancer 2011;117:1946-56.

Preanalytic variation may contribute to discordant results. Recently, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) made recommendations to normalize fixation for breast biomarkers. To evaluate this, a 4-cm invasive lobular carcinoma was processed according to ASCO/CA.P guidelines. The remainder was stored fresh at 4 degrees C for 4 days and cut into biopsy-sized pieces. Each was fixed in 10% formalin, Pen-Fix (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI), Bouin solution, Sakura Molecular Fixative (Sakura Tissue-Tek Xpress, Torrance, CA), zinc formalin, or 15% formaldehyde for tunes ranging between I and 168 hours. Immunohistochemical studies for ER and PR were performed and interpreted. After 4 days at 4 degrees C, all samples showed no degradation or ER/PR staining differences, except 2 Bouin-fixed samples, in comparison with the patient's sample processed according to ASCO/CAP guidelines. in our study, the preanalytic variables of fixative type, fixation time, and 4 days of ischemic time did not affect immunohistochemical accuracy for ER/PR.														0002-9173	1943-7722	10.1309/AJCPB1RIT5YXMRIS

Invasive lobular cancer (L) differs clinically and morphologically from invasive ductal cancer (D); differences notwithstanding, Nottingham grades are provided in both. This study compared 22,719 lobular carcinomas with 201,517 ductal carcinomas, dividing them into the grades: well differentiated (W), moderately differentiated (M), poorly differentiated (P), and ungraded to see if differences between comparable grades of lobular and ductal cancer were uniform, consistent with the notion the grading system provides similar information for both cancer subtypes.Methods. The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to limn relationships among grades, as respects proportions of patients with T3 tumors and nodal metastases, as well as cancer-specific survival. Taken into account were age, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and the administration of radiotherapy.Results. More lobular than ductal carcinomas were T3; grades were not homogenous, with the incidence rate ratio (IRR) comparing lobular and ductal carcinomas being 8.2 for well differentiated, 4.1 for moderately differentiated, and 2.48 for poorly differentiated. With respect to nodal metastases, the 1.16 W L: W D IRR (P < 0.05) was not explicable by chance, but both the 0.97 M L: M D IRR (P > 0.05) and the 0.96 P L: P D IRR (P > 0.05) could have been due to chance. As respects survival, neither the 1.4 P L: P D time ratio (TR) (P < 0.05) nor the 1.23 M L: M D TR (P < 0.05) could have been explained by chance; the 1.05 W L: W D (P > 0.05) might have been due to chance.Conclusion. Grades of lobular carcinoma imply different meanings than do grades of ductal carcinoma. Studies of breast cancer should not assume commonality with respect to grade. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, the group of claudin-low tumors have recently been identified as a molecular subgroup of breast carcinoma. In our study, we examined the expression pattern of claudins, beta-catenin and E-cadherin in invasive ductal (IDCs) and lobular (ILCs) carcinomas and their corresponding lymph node metastases (LNMs). Tissue microarrays of 97 breast samples (60 invasive ductal carcinomas, 37 invasive lobular carcinomas) and their corresponding LNMs have been analyzed immunohistochemically for claudin-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -7, beta-catenin and E-cadherin expression. The stained slides were digitalized with a slide scanner and the reactions were evaluated semiquantitatively. When compared to LNMs, in the IDC group beta-catenin and claudin-2, -3, -4 and -7 protein expression showed different pattern while claudin-1, -2, -3, -4 and -7 were differently expressed in the ILC group. Lymph node metastases developed a notable increase of claudin-5 expression in both groups. Decrease or loss of claudin-1 and expression of claudin-4 in lymph node metastases correlated with reduced disease-free survival in our patients. According to our observations, the expression of epithelial junctional molecules, especially claudins, is different in primary breast carcinomas compared to their lymph node metastases as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Loss of claudin junctional molecules might contribute to tumor progression, and certain claudin expression pattern might be of prognostic relevance.

Are proliferating cells, within the bulk of tumor, few cells with uncommon features? The cell biological approach provides a limitless model for studying the hierarchical organization of progenitor subpopulation and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Aim of the study was to expand patients' breast cancer cells for evaluating functional cell properties, and to characterize the protein expression profile of selected cells to be compared with that of primary tumors. Breast cancer cells from estrogen receptor (ER alpha) positive, HER2 negative lobular (LoBS cells) and ductal (DuBS cells) histotype were cultured under non-adherent conditions to form mammospheres. Sorting of the cells by their surface expression of CD24 and CD44 gave rise to subpopulations which were propagated, enriched and characterized for the expression of epithelial and stromal markers. We found that non-adherent culture conditions generate mammospheres of slowly proliferating cells; single cells, dissociated from mammospheres, grow in soft agar; long-term cultured LoBS and DuBS cells, CD44+/CD24low, express cytokeratin 5 (CK5), alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-sma) and vimentin, known as markers of basal/myoepithelial cells; and ER alpha (only DuBS cells), HER1 (EGF-Receptor), activated HER2, and cyclinD1 as markers of luminal epithelial cell.

Y.; Aydinh, K.; Calay, Z.; Dunder, I.									European Journal of Gynaecological Oncology		2011		32	5	560-562	560	562							Metastasis of extragenital neoplasms to the uterus is extremely rare. Lobular breast cancers metastasize to the uterus more than ductal carcinomas, but they metastasize as tiny nodules that can be missed with the standard diagnostic workup. Uterine involvement by a metastatic tumor is usually a manifestation of end-stage disease; patients are reported to die within weeks to months. Therefore surgery is not recommended. Here we report a case of lobular breast cancer metastasizing to a leiomyoma in a patient using letrozole. Our patient was submitted to surgery because the leiomyoma had grown to the level of the xiphoid process. She is alive one year after the operation. In conclusion growth of leiomyomas under aromatase inhibitors should be considered as a sign of metastases and surgery can be planned in selected cases.														0392-2936

The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is controlled by the bcl-2 protein family. Overexpression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 4 (UCP4) can promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis and differentiation. Imprint smears obtained from 124 tumors were studied immunocytochemically, and results were correlated with prognostic markers. There were 112 ductal and 12 lobular carcinomas. The positivity of UCP4 was correlated with lymph node metastases (p = 0.005), positive ER and PR expression (p < 0.0001 for both), as well as positivity for p53 (p < 0.0001) and Ki-67 (p < 0.0001). Decreased expression of bcl-2 correlated with increased expression of UCP4 (p = 0.001). Regarding DNA ploidy, UCP4 positivity was correlated with aneuploid tumors (p = 0.002). Negative expression of bcl-2 was correlated with poorly differentiated carcinomas (p < 0.0001), as well as with positive expression of p53 (p < 0.0001) and Ki-67 (p < 0.0001). Logistic regression revealed that ploidy and p53 expression had an impact on UCP4. These findings encourage future investigations regarding the potential role of UCPs not only into mechanisms underlying breast cancer, but also as a novel candidate to the design and development of more effective therapeutic strategies.

Anticancer Research		2010	DEC 2010	30	12	5137-5144	5137	5144							Background: Treatment decisions in breast cancer depend on TNM classification and the assessment of additional variables with have an impact on survival. We examined whether histological subtyping breast cancer as either ductal or lobular is related to disease outcome. Patients and Methods: We examined a large data base of 14198 breast cancer patients. Results: Histological sub-classification of invasive breast cancer as either ductal or lobular is not correlated with disease outcome. However, the data further showed that invasive lobular carcinomas have a higher probability of being oestrogen receptor (ER)and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive and a lower probability of being c-erbB2-positive. They also showed a higher average age at the time of diagnosis in comparison with invasive ductal carcinoma. Local recurrence rates were lower in invasive lobular carcinoma in comparison with invasive ductal carcinoma (3.5% vs. 6.2%; p=0.031). The multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that ER, PR, nodal status, grade and tumour size predicted disease outcome with statistical significance, while the histological subtype (invasive ductal or lobular) was not a significant predictor of disease outcome. Conclusion: Histological sub-classification of invasive breast cancer as either ductal or lobular is not correlated with disease outcome. On the other hand our data gives some indication that lobular and ductal breast cancer appear to be different biological entities.

Li, Jun Lai (li_jl@yeah.net) ; Wang, Zhi Li; Su, Li; Liu, Xiao Jun; Tang, Jie									Breast		2010	DEC 2010	19	6	446-449	446	449							The aim of this study was to evaluate if re-biopsy with 10-gauge vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) could get definitive diagnosis for breast lesions with ultrasound (US) imaging-histologic discordance at 16-gauge core needle biopsy (CNB).From January 2007 to June 2008, a consecutive biopsy was performed on 1069 lesions with US-guided 16-gauge CNB. A total of 28 lesions were considered to be US imaging-histologic discordant and all of them underwent subsequent 10-gauge VAB. All malignant lesions located at VAB were treated with subsequent surgery and all benign lesions at VAB were followed up for at least 1 year.Six of the 28 lesions (21.4%) had pathologic upgrade after VAB. In them, one case upgraded from adenosis to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); one case upgraded from adenosis to infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC); one case upgraded from atypical ductal hyperplasia to IDC; two cases upgraded from intraductal papilloma to DCIS; and one case upgraded from sclerosing adenosis to invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). The subsequent surgery further demonstrated the diagnosis of VAB for all the lesions with histologic upgrade.Re-biopsy could improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with breast lesions showing imaging-histologic discordance during CNB, and 10-gauge VAB was a valuable method to deal with re-biopsy.

However, its role in the tumor progression of breast cancer has not been explored. HAb18G expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in pathological sections of 1,637 breast tissue samples and by in situ hybridization in 41 cases of invasive breast carcinomas (BC). While not detected in any cases of tumor-like conditions or benign tumors of breast, and only rarely in normal tissue (4.4%), HAb18G expression was gradually up-regulated from atypical ductal hyperplasia (27.3%), to ductal carcinoma-in situ (59.8%), and to BC (61.4%) (P < 0.01). Its expression in BC was correlated positively with C-erbB-2 expression and histologic grade (P < 0.001), and negatively with the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors (P < 0.001). Significant differences of expression were also identified among the subgroups of BC examined: in decreasing order from invasive micropapillary carcinoma, ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, to mucinous adenocarcinoma (P = 0.001), corresponding to their known clinical aggressiveness. In an expanded group of 186 BC patients with proper follow up, our previous findings were confirmed: HAb18G expression was significantly associated with local recurrence, distant metastasis and tumor mortality (P < 0.01). We also demonstrated that up-regulated tumor expression of HAb18G was a significant predictor of reduced disease progression-free survival rate and a shorter overall survival, independent of systemic therapies. In conclusion, this study suggests that HAb18G expression is associated with BC progression and prognosis. Further evaluation of this new marker in breast cancer is indicated.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-010-0790-6

The authors hypothesized that the test is ordered when clinicopathological variables yield equivocal risk estimates. The current study also showed how often the test clarifies clinically ambiguous risk status. METHODS: The authors examined clinical/pathological characteristics and calculated risk of recurrence with Adjuvantl for 309 consecutive patients who underwent Oncotype DX testing at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. RESULTS: Of the patients comprising this study, most had stage I/II (n = 306, 99%) and grade I/II tumors (n = 236, 76%). The median risk of recurrence by Adjuvantl was 16% (IQR 11.2 to 20.4). Oncotype DX stratified 52% (n = 160), 40% (n = 122) and 9% (n = 27) of this clinically intermediate risk population into low, intermediate, and high risk groups, respectively. Correlation between projected risk of recurrence by Adjuvantl (Adjuvantl, online software and website) and Oncotype DX was minimal (r = 0.13). Recurrence score (P < .0001), but not age or tumor size, was higher in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. In all 3 grade subsets, recurrence score was higher in those who received chemotherapy compared with those who did not (P = .02, P < .0001, and P = .0009, respectively). All lobular carcinomas (n = 40) were classified as low/intermediate risk. CONCLUSIONS: Oncotype DX yielded potentially informative risk assignments in patients considered indeterminate risk by routine clinical variables. However, 40% of the time test results reflected intermediate risk, with widely used recurrence score thresholds.

Patients who had invasive lobular carcinoma on needle biopsy were candidates for this study. Touch preparations from every sentinel lymph node were prospectively prepared in the same manner, one stained with modified Alcian blue and one with conventional staining. These slides were independently interpreted.Results.-A total of 121 sentinel lymph nodes from 31 patients with invasive lobular carcinoma were studied. There were 11 patients (35.5%) who had at least one positive lymph node test result. There were a total of 18 positive lymph node results (14.9%). Although 10 sentinel lymph nodes with abnormalities were detected in 7 patients with conventional staining, modified Alcian blue detected 15 sentinel lymph node abnormalities in 10 patients. Modified Alcian blue increased the sensitivity compared with conventional staining from 63.6% to 90.9% (calculated based on the number of patients) and from 55.6% to 83.3% (calculated based on number of sentinel lymph nodes). The staining process takes approximately 11 minutes.Conclusions.-Modified Alcian blue stain is a relatively rapid, cheap, highly sensitive, and specific method of detecting metastatic invasive lobular carcinoma. This method can be used in conjunction with conventional staining methods used intraoperatively. (Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2010;134:1513-1519)														0003-9985	1543-2165

We postulate that strict adherence to American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) 2003 criteria may result in inaccurate staging of lobular carcinoma patients. We reviewed cases of metastatic lobular carcinoma in sentinel lymph node biopsies between 1998 and 2008. All sentinel lymph nodes were reassessed using strict adherence to AJCC 2003 criteria. Subsequent axillary lymph node dissection and clinical follow-up were reviewed. Fifty-one patients met our inclusion criteria and were originally classified by the primary pathologist as follows: 10 isolated tumor cells, 8 micrometastases, 27 macrometastases, and 6 'positive' cases without further classification. Cases were re-classified using strict adherence to AJCC 2003 criteria as follows: 21 isolated tumor cells, 2 micrometastases, and 28 macrometastases. Twelve isolated tumor cells cases underwent full axillary dissection, and 3 (25%) had additional macrometastases. All micrometastatic cases underwent axillary dissection: all were negative. Twenty-two macrometastatic cases underwent full axillary dissection and 16 (73%) had additional macrometastases. Diffuse single cells or small clusters should not be interpreted as isolated tumor cells in invasive lobular carcinoma sentinel lymph nodes. The criteria for assessing small volume metastases in the sentinel lymph node of patients with invasive lobular carcinoma need to be more clearly defined. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This association is thought to be largely hormonally driven, so alcohol use may be more strongly associated with hormonally sensitive breast cancers. Few studies have evaluated how alcohol-related risk varies by breast cancer subtype.Methods We assessed the relationship between self-reported alcohol consumption and postmenopausal breast cancer risk among 87 724 women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study prospective cohort from 1993 through 1998. Multivariable adjusted Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical tests were two-sided.Results A total of 2944 invasive breast cancer patients were diagnosed during follow-up through September 15, 2005. In multivariable adjusted analyses, alcohol consumption was positively related to risk of invasive breast cancer overall, invasive lobular carcinoma, and hormone receptor-positive tumors (all P-trend <= .022). However, alcohol consumption was more strongly related to risk of certain types of invasive breast cancer compared with others. Compared with never drinkers, women who consumed seven or more alcoholic beverages per week had an almost twofold increased risk of hormone receptor-positive invasive lobular carcinoma (HR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.18 to 2.81) but not a statistically significant increased risk of hormone receptor-positive invasive ductal carcinoma (HR = 1.14; 95% CI = 0.87 to 1.50; difference in HRs per drink per day among current drinkers = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.32, P = .042). The absolute rates of hormone receptor-positive lobular cancer among never drinkers and current drinkers were, 5.2 and 8.5 per 10 000 person-years, respectively, whereas for hormne receptor-positive ductal cancer they were 15.2 and 17.9 per 10 000 person-years, respectively.Conclusions Alcohol use may be more strongly associated with risk of hormone-sensitive breast cancers than hormone-insensitive subtypes, suggesting distinct etiologic pathways for these two breast cancer subtypes.														0027-8874		10.1093/jnci/djq316

British Journal of Cancer		2010	JUL 13 2010	103	2	249-255	249	255							PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype of breast cancer that is oestrogen receptor (ER) negative, progesterone receptor (PR) negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative, has a poor prognosis. Although a correlation between E-cadherin expression level and outcome has been demonstrated among all types of breast cancer, little is known about the significance of E-cadherin expression levels in TNBC.METHODS: A total of 574 patients who had undergone a resection of a primary breast cancer except for invasive lobular carcinomas were enrolled in this study. Expressions of ER, PR, HER2, and E-cadherin were assessed by immunohistochemistry. We examined the association between TNBC and other clinicopathological variables and evaluated the significance of the E-cadherin expression.RESULTS: Among the 574 breast cancer cases, 123 (21.4%) revealed a triple-negative phenotype. Patients with TNBC experienced more frequent lymph node metastasis (P=0.024) and a poorer prognosis (P<0.001) in comparison with non-TNBC patients. Triple-negative breast cancer was an independent prognostic factor. Reduced levels of E-cadherin were observed in 238 (41.5%) of the 574 breast cancer cases. E-cadherin reduction was significantly frequent in cases of TNBC (P<0.001) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.032). Furthermore, in the 123 TNBC cases, the prognosis of patients with an E-cadherin-negative expression was significantly worse than that of E-cadherin-positive patients (P=0.0265), especially for those in clinical stage II (P=0.002). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a reduction of the E-cadherin expression to be an independent prognostic factor (P=0.046).CONCLUSION: E-cadherin expression may be a useful prognostic marker for classifying subgroups of TNBC.

J	BCI:BCI201100247426	21761358			Risk of Mortality by Histologic Type of Breast Cancer in the United States		Li, Christopher I. (cili@fhcrc.org)									Hormones & Cancer		2010	JUN 2010	1	3	156-165	156	165							There are several histologic types of breast cancer that beyond their histopathologic differences have distinct clinical characteristics. However, it is unclear how histology is related to risk of mortality particularly when differences in hormone receptor status, tumor size, and nodal status are incorporated. This study utilized a cohort of 319,463 breast cancer patients >= 30 years of age diagnosed from 1992 to 2007 identified from 17 population-based cancer registries that participate in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program. Multivariate adjusted risks of mortality associated with seven breast cancer histologic subtypes were estimated using Cox regression. Mucinous, tubular, and medullary carcinomas were associated with 31-79% lower risks of mortality compared to ductal carcinoma. Inflammatory breast cancer was associated with a 50-53% increased risk of mortality depending on age. While lobular carcinomas carried the same risk of mortality as ductal carcinoma among women 30-49 years of age, among women >= 50 years of age with node-negative disease lobular carcinoma was associated with an 11% reduced risk of mortality, but among those with node-positive disease it was associated with a 10% increased risk of mortality. This study confirms that mucinous, tubular, and medullary carcinomas have a more favorable prognosis compared to ductal carcinoma, and that inflammatory carcinoma has a poorer prognosis. Though many of these histologic subtypes are quite rare, consideration of the mortality risk associated with a given subtype may be clinically useful when making decisions regarding treatment and follow-up.														1868-8497	1868-8500	10.1007/s12672-010-0016-8

(investigacion@hospitaldejove.com)									Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology		2010	JUN 2010	136	6	811-819	811	819							Metalloproteases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs) are involved in several key aspects of tumoral growth, invasion and metastasis. The purpose of this study was to characterize on how the different histological types of breast cancer differ in the expression of several components of this enzymatic system.An immunohistochemical study was performed in 50 ductal, 23 lobular, 14 mucinous, 7 tubular, 4 papillary and 5 medullary invasive carcinomas, using tissue arrays and specific antibodies against 7 MMPs and 3 tisullar TIMPs. Staining results were categorized by means of a specific software program (score values).Carcinomas of the ductal type showed higher score values for MMPs and TIMPs than the other histological types; whereas mucinous carcinomas had lower scores values for expressions of the majority of these proteins. Stromal fibroblasts were more frequently positive for MMP-1, -7 and -13 and TIMP-1 and -3, when present in carcinomas of the ductal type than in other histological types of breast carcinomas. Stromal mononuclear inflammatory cells were more frequently positive for MMP-1 and TIMP-3, but more often negative for MMP-7, -9 and -11, when located in carcinomas of the ductal type than in other histological types of breast carcinomas.We found variations in MMP/TIMP expressions among the different histological subtypes of breast carcinomas suggesting differences in their tumor pathophysiology.														0171-5216	1432-1335	10.1007/s00432-009-0721-2

Bioconjugate Chemistry		2010	MAY 2010	21	5	816-827	816	827							To develop novel bifunctional agents for tumor imaging (MR) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), certain tumor-avid photosensitizers derived from chlorophyll-a were conjugated with variable number of Gd(III)aminobenzyl DTPA moieties. All the conjugates containing three or six gadolinium units showed significant T-1 and T-2 relaxivities. However, as a bifunctional agent, the 3-(1'-hexyloxyethyl)pyropheophorbide-a (HPPH) containing 3Gd(III) aminophenyl DTPA was most promising with possible applications in tumor-imaging and PDT. Compared to HPPH, the corresponding 3- and 6Gd(III)aminobenzyl DTPA conjugates exhibited similar electronic absorption characteristics with a slightly decreased intensity of the absorption band at 660 nm. However, compared to HPPH, the excitation of the broad "Soret" band (near 400 nm) of the corresponding 3Gd(III)aminobenzyl-DTPA analogues showed a significant decrease in the fluorescence intensity at 667 nm.														1043-1802		10.1021/bc9005305

This study examines stathmin expression in breast cancers from patients treated with anti-tubulin chemotherapy.Methods: We reviewed breast cancers from 44 women enrolled in a randomized trial of neoadjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide +/- docetaxel, including 39 with invasive ductal carcinoma and 5 with invasive lobular carcinoma. Microarray blocks were constructed from pre- and posttreatment tissues and assayed for stathmin by IHC. Analyses of the stained slides were performed using Aperio Scanscope CS/GL (R) and TMALab (R) software. Tissues were evaluated for % staining of strong positive cells, with 4% used as a cut-off value for high vs. low expression.Results: The percentage of strong positive staining of stathmin in invasive ductal carcinomas ranged from 0.5% to 62% with mean 14.4%. Invasive lobular carcinomas had significantly less strong positive stathmin staining, from 0.07% to 3.3% (p = 0.00016, Student's t-test, two-tailed). Comparison of the recurrences in high vs. low stathmin was 47% to 21%. There was no correlation with survival or response to chemotherapy.Conclusion: Invasive lobular carcinomas had lower intensity stathmin expression than ductal carcinomas. Stathmin expression tended to be higher in tumors that recurred.														0892-6638	1530-6860

Methods The expression of Twist, E-cadherin and N-cadherin in 56 cases of breast invasive ductal carcinoma,38 cases of invasive lobular carcinoma,41 cases of carcinoma in situ and 10 cases of normal breast tissue was detected using immunohistochemistry. Results (1) The expression rate of Twist in three types of breast carcinoma was 46.4% (26/56) 79.0% (30/38) and 26.8% (11/41) respectively, and the expression of Twist in invasive lobular carcinoma was significantly higher than that in invasive ductal carcinoma and carcinoma in situ (P = 0.002, P = 0.000). The expression rate of E-cadherin in three types of breast carcinoma was 78.6% (44/56) 29.0% (11/38) and 80.5% (33/41) respectively, and the expression of E-cadherin in invasive ductal carcinoma and carcinoma in situ was significantly higher than that in invasive lobular carcinoma (P = 0.000, P = 0.000). The expression rate of N-cadherin in three types of breast carcinoma was 53.6% (30/56) 68.4% (26/38) and 31.7% (13/41) respectively, and the expression of N-cadherin in invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma was significantly higher than that in carcinoma in situ (P = 0.033, P = 0.001). (2) In all the 135 cases, the expression of Twist was not correlated with that of E-cadherin P = 0.005, Spearman correlation coefficient = -0.239), however, there was a positive correlation between the expression of Twist and N-cadherin and statistically significant (P = 0.000, Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.319). (3) In the invasive ductal carcinoma, the expression of N-cadherin in poorly-differentiated carcinoma was significantly higher than that of the moderately-or well-differentiated ones (P = 0.004). ( 4) In the invasive lobular carcinoma, the expression of Twist in cases with lymph node metastasis was significantly higher than that of cases without metastasis (P = 0.037). Conclusions Twist, E-cadherin and N-cadherin have different expression patterns in the three kinds of breast carcinoma. The positive expression of Twist was correlated to lymph node metastasis in invasive lobular carcinoma and the positive expression of N-cadherin was correlated to cell the tissue differentiation in invasive ductal carcinoma. Detection of the expression of these biomarkers may provide a valuable reference for the study of breast carcinoma progression, metastasis and for the judgment of the biological behavior of the carcinoma.														0529-5807		10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2010.01.003

Comparison study between MRI, gross, and microscopic tumor sizes in breast cancer in lumpectomy specimens		Behjatnia, Bita; Sim, Julie; Bassett, Lawrence W.; Moatamed, Neda A.; Apple, Sophia K. (sapple@mednet.ucla.edu)									International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Pathology		2010		3	3	303-309	303	309							Size of breast cancer is essential in staging cancer to determine type and extent of patient management. This study was conducted to assess accuracy in estimating tumor size by MRI and gross using microscopy as gold standard. A retrospective study was done on 33 patients, 30-75 years, who underwent MRI of breasts with subsequent lumpectomy, 2002-2006, for invasive breast cancer. Size of lesion(s) on MRI and gross were compared with histological size. Of 37 lesions, 27 (73%) were invasive ductal (IDC) and 10 (27%) invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Tumor size by MRI matched histological size in 3%, underestimated 27%, and overestimated 70% of cases. Tumor size by gross matched histological size in 22%, underestimated 57%, and overestimated 22% of cases. MRI as an imaging modality and gross pathology both have significant limitations in measuring tumor size particularly in cases of invasive breast carcinoma. Random sectioning of lumpectomy specimen in invasive breast carcinoma may result in inaccurate staging of tumor by leading to false impression of tumor size and multi-focality and/or multi-centricity of tumor particularly in cases of ILC. Microscopic measurements of tumor size are necessary for accurate T-staging and recommended for appropriate patient management.														1936-2625																				
J	BCI:BCI201000089322	19885731			The impact of preoperative breast MRI on the re-excision rate in invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast		Mann, R. M. (r.mann@rad.umcn.nl) ; Loo, C. E.; Wobbes, T.; Bult, P.; Barentsz, J. O.; Gilhuijs, K. G. A.; Boetes, C.									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2010	JAN 2010	119	2	415-422	415	422							Re-excision rates after breast conserving surgery (BCS) of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) are high. Preoperative breast MRI has the potential to reduce re-excision rates, but may lead to an increased rate of mastectomies. Hence, we assessed the influence of preoperative breast MRI on the re-excision rate and the rate of mastectomies. We performed a retrospective cohort study of a consecutive series of patients with ILC who presented in one of two dedicated tertiary cancer centers between 1993 and 2005. We assessed the initial type of surgery (BCS or mastectomy), the re-excision rate and the final type of surgery. Patients were stratified into two groups: those who received preoperative MRI (MR+ group) and those who did not (MR- group). In the MR- group, 27% of the patients underwent a re-excision after initial BCS. In the MR+ group, this rate was significantly lower at 9%. The odds ratio was 3.64 (95% CI: 1.30-10.20, P = 0.010). There was a trend towards a lower final mastectomy rate in the MR+ group compared to the MR- group (48 vs. 59%, P = 0.098). In conclusion, preoperative MRI in patients with ILC can reduce re-excision rates without increasing the rate of mastectomies.

(Jorge.Reis-Filho@icr.ac.uk)									Journal of Pathology		2010	JAN 2010	220	1	45-57	45	57							Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the most frequent special type of breast cancer. The majority of these tumours are of low histological grade, express hormone receptors, and lack HER2 expression. The pleomorphic variant of ILCs (PLCs) is characterized by atypical cells with pleomorphic nuclei and is reported to have an aggressive clinical behaviour. Expression profiling studies have demonstrated that classic ILCs preferentially display a luminal phenotype, whereas PLCs may be of luminal, HER2 or molecular apocrine subtypes. The aims of this study were two-fold: to determine the transcriptomic characteristics of lobular carcinomas and to define the genome-wide transcriptomic differences between classic ILCs and PLCs. To define the transcriptomic characteristics of ILCs, minimizing the impact of histological grade and molecular subtype on the analysis, we subjected a series of grade- and molecular subtype-matched ILCs and invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) to genome-wide gene expression profiling using oligonucleotide microarrays. Hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that ILCs formed a separate cluster and a supervised analysis revealed that 5.8% of the transcriptionally regulated genes were significantly differentially expressed in ILCs compared to grade- and molecular subtype-matched IDCs. ILCs displayed down-regulation of E-cadherin and of genes related to actin cytoskeleton remodelling. protein ubiquitin, DNA repair, cell adhesion, TGF-beta signalling; and up-regulation of transcription factors/immediate early genes, lipid/prostaglandin biosynthesis genes, and cell migration-associated genes. Supervised analysis of classic ILCs and PLCs demonstrated that less than 0.1% of genes were significantly differentially expressed between these tumour subtypes. Our results demonstrate that ILCs differ from grade- and molecular subtype-matched IDCs in the expression of genes related to cell adhesion, cell-to-cell signalling, and actin cytoskeleton signalling. However, classic ILCs and PLCs are remarkably similar at the molecular level and should be considered as part of a spectrum of lesions.

The radiological and pathological factors relating to the success of FNAC in breast cancer series were evaluated. METHODS: Between July 1999 and June 2004, 418 breast cancers were submitted to FNAC in the Verona Breast Cancer Screening Program. The results of FNAC diagnoses were compared with final histology. The FNAC sensitivity rate, underestimation of malignancy rate, and inadequacy rate were correlated with histotype, size, grading, and radiologic imaging. RESULTS: Of the 418 cancers, 95 were in situ, and 323 were invasive. The sensitivity rate was higher in invasive cancers (P < .001), and the underestimation of malignancy rate was greater in in situ cancers (P = .002). Lobular type cancers had a lower sensitivity rate in invasive and in situ cancers. The sensitivity rate was 100% in medullary, mucinous, and papillary cancers, and no case had inadequate sampling. The underestimation of malignancy rate was higher in tubular carcinoma (18.2%); lobular carcinoma showed a higher inadequacy rate (10.4%). The sensitivity rate was lower and the underestimation of malignancy rate was higher in low-grade carcinomas and in lesions <1 cm (P < .001). The performance of FNAC was not significantly influenced by mammographic imaging of lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Low-grade cancer histotype, cancer size <1 cm, and lobular and tubular histotypes limit the possibility of obtaining positive results by FNAC. Operator experience and multidisciplinary consultation may help in overcoming these limitations. Pathologists must be aware of the limits of FNAC; results must be critically evaluated in light of the triple assessment. Cancer (Cancer Cytopathol) 2009;117:491-9.

(otawfik@kumc.edu)									Annals of Clinical and Laboratory Science		2009	WIN 2009	39	1	25-31	25	31							Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast is currently graded according to the Nottingham modification of the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson system (SBR). This system involves subjective evaluation of 3 morphologic features: tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphisrn, and mitosis. Our recently proposed semi-automated Nuclear and Proliferation Index [N+P] grading system for IDC has demonstrated agreement among grades and prognostic markers with better prediction of patient survival than the SBR system. Our present objective is to expand the utilization of the N+P system to grading invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Fifty-eight ILC cases were evaluated by the SBR and N+P systems. The 2 systems were compared in terms of correlation with patient survival, tumor size, grade, angiolymphatic invasion, lymph node status, ploidy status, and ER, PR, Her-2, p53, EGFR, and Bcl-2 staining. The N+P and SBR systems demonstrated overall agreement when correlated with clinical and prognostic parameters. Twenty-four of 30 tumors initially classified as SBR Grade II were down-graded to N+P I. Three of 26 tumors initially classified as SBR Grade I were up-graded to N+P II. Grading of ILC provides valuable predictive and prognostic information. The N+P grading system for ILC decreases the element of subjectivity for assessing mitotic activity and appears to be superior to the SBR system in predicting patient survival.

Breast cancer is the first most prevalent cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in Taiwan. The early stage of breast cancer not only have a wider range of therapeutic options, but also obtain a higher success rate of therapy than those with advanced breast cancer. A test for tumor markers is the most convenient method to screen for breast cancer. However, the tumor markers currently available for breast cancer detection include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 15.3 (CA15.3), and carbohydrate antigen 27.29 (CA27.29) exhibited certain limitations. Poor sensitivity and specificity greatly limits the diagnostic accuracy of these markers. This study aims to identify potential tumor markers for breast cancer. At first, we analyzed genes expression in infiltrating lobular carcinoma, metaplastic carcinoma, and infiltrating ductal carcinoma of paired specimens (tumor and normal tissue) from breast cancer patients using microarray technology. We selected 371 overexpressed genes in all of the three cell type. In advanced breast cancer tissue, we detected four genes MMP13, CAMP, COL10A1 and FLJ25416 from 25 overexpressed genes which encoded secretion protein more specifically for breast cancer than other genes. After validation with 15 pairs of breast cancer tissue and paired to normal adjacent tissues by membrane array and quantitative RT-PCR, we found MMP13 was 100% overexpressed and confirmed to be a secreted protein by Western blot analysis of the cell culture medium. The expression level of MMP13 was also measured by immunohistochemical staining. We suggest that MMP13 is a highly overexpressed secretion protein in breast cancer tissue. It has potential to be a new tumor marker for breast cancer diagnosis.			Hou, Ming-Feng/D-5506-2009; Lin, Shinne-Ren/C-9638-2009											1021-335X		10.3892/or_00000544

(wwood@emory.edu)									Breast		2009	OCT 2009	18	Suppl. 3	S93-S95	S93	S95							Recent studies have shown a dramatic increase in the use of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM). The choice of surgical procedure is primarily influenced by the recommendations of physicians and surgeons. As smaller breast cancers are detected by improved breast screening, and larger breast cancers are reduced in size by neo-adjuvant chemo- and endocrine therapy, breast conservation therapy (BCT) has been applicable to more women. No one would advocate CPM with the breast primary was to be treated by BCT. This makes the more than doubling of the rate of CPM even harder to understand.The ability to better define inherited breast cancer risk by genetic analysis of BRCA1 or 2 mutations does identify a group of patients at greatly increased lifetime risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC). This segment of the population does not account for the sharp increase in CPM. It appears that many physicians and surgeons believe the risk of contralateral breast cancer to be sufficiently high to justify advising CPM. This risk is often overestimated by both healthcare providers and patients. The case for additional surgery should involve considerations of risk versus benefit, mortality being the principal patient concern and morbidity secondary. Yet there is some morbidity in adding a second mastectomy, and no evidence of mortality benefit.Invasive lobular carcinoma is considered by some physicians to represent an increased risk of contralateral cancer, but that has not proved to be correct. Women with lobular carcinoma in situ or atypical ductal hyperplasia found at the time of their cancer diagnosis are sometimes advised to consider CPM. Treatment with tamoxifen has shown a 50-75% reduction in risk from these tissue findings. Chemotherapy for the primary breast cancer also lowers contralateral risk by about 20%. Symmetry is another reason some have recommended CPM. Reduction can be performed rather than mastectomy, if required. The use of skin-sparing mastectomy has greatly reduced the incidence of any surgery needed for symmetry on the contralateral breast.MRI used to "stage the breast" can raise questions by noting small foci of enhancement in the contralateral breast. Some women elect CPM rather than biopsy or further imaging of the contralateral breast.The case can be made that CPM should be on the decline. Its increase raises questions of the awareness of breast oncologists, medical and surgical, of the true risk data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The present series comprises 301 consecutive "classic" lobular breast carcinomas seen at one institution between 1994 and 2001, compared to an equal number of invasive ductal carcinomas at the same institution during the same period, matched for year of surgery, age, menopausal status, primary tumor size, nodal involvement, hormone receptor status and where possible histological grade. Despite matching, the lobular carcinomas were more frequently multifocal, had more involved nodes, lower grade and lower proliferative fraction. There was no significant difference in disease-free or overall survival, locoregional relapse or time to distant metastasis between the lobular and ductal groups overall or within any examined subset, though the lobular group showed a trend to earlier appearance of contralateral breast cancer. Classical lobular histology is not an independent factor in the prognosis of early breast cancer.

Modern Pathology		2009	SEP 2009	22	9	1169-1175	1169	1175							The HER2 gene is an important prognostic and therapeutic marker in newly diagnosed breast cancer. Currently, HER2 status is most frequently determined by immunohistochemical detection of HER2 protein expression on the cellular membrane surface or by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of HER2 gene copy number in fixed tissue using locus-specific probes for the HER2 gene and chromosome 17 centromere. However, these methods are problematic because of issues with intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility and preanalytic variables, such as fixation time. In addition, the commonly used HER2/chromosome 17 ratio presumes that chromosome 17 polysomy is present when the centromere is amplified, even though analysis of the rest of the chromosome is not included in the assay. In this study, 97 frozen samples of invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma, with known immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization results for HER2, were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization to a commercially available bacterial artificial chromosome whole-genome array containing 99 probes targeted to chromosome 17 and the HER2/TOP2 amplicon. Results were 97% concordant for HER2 status, meeting the College of American Pathologists/American Society of Clinical Oncology's validation requirements for HER2 testing. Surprisingly, not a single case of complete polysomy 17 was detected even though multiple breast cancer cases showed clear polysomies of other chromosomes. We conclude that array comparative genomic hybridization is an accurate and objective DNA-based alternative for clinical evaluation of HER2 gene copy number, and that polysomy 17 is a rare event in breast cancer.

Charles; Stebbing, Justin (j.stebbing@imperial.ac.uk)									European Journal of Cancer		2009	AUG 2009	45	12	2146-2149	2146	2149							Background: Peritoneal metastases are now a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced breast cancer. There are few published data regarding the prognosis, clinical characteristics and management of individuals with peritoneal metastases from breast cancer.Methods: The electronic database at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (Charing Cross Hospital) was searched for the terms 'breast', 'cancer' or 'tumour', 'peritoneal' and 'ascites' from 2000 to 2008. Those with confirmed peritoneal disease from breast cancer, as described on ultrasound or staging CT reports with a clinico-pathologic confirmed diagnosis, were included.Results: A total of 1628 patients were screened and initially 168 patients were identified. A subsequent total of 44 individuals (2.7% of the cohort) were defined as having breast cancer with peritoneal secondaries and were included in the analysis. Of these, the majority (77%) had invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs). While the median survival from the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer measured 20.5 months (range 0.1-125 months), the median survival of patients with peritoneal disease was 1.56 months (range 0.2-27 months).Conclusions: These data demonstrate that the median survival of patients with peritoneal breast cancer metastasis is surprisingly poor, with only a minority surviving more than 6 months. A specific association with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) was not observed. The dismal outcome of these individuals, despite further active therapy, merits their inclusion into clinical trials designed specifically for this group of patients. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Although it has been known that distinct glycan structures are associated with cancer, the whole spectrum of cancer-associated glycans has remained undiscovered. In the present study, we analyzed the protein-linked cancer glycome by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric glycan profiling of cancer patient tissue samples. In lung cancer, we detected accumulation of a novel group of tumor-associated glycans. These protein-linked glycans carried abnormal nonreducing terminal beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. A similar phenomenon was also detected in structural analyses of tumor-derived glycosphingolipids. This showed that glycan biosynthesis may dramatically change in cancer and that direct glycome analysis can detect the resulting marker glycans. Based on the structural knowledge, we further devised a covalent labeling technique for the detection of GlcNAc-expressing tumors with a specific transferase enzyme. In normal tissues, terminal GlcNAc antigens are capped by galactosylation. Similarly to common cancer-associated glycan antigens T, Tn, and sialyl-Tn, the newly discovered GlcNAc antigens result from incomplete glycosylation. In conclusion, the identified terminal GlcNAc glycans should be recognized as a novel class of tumor markers.

Methods: A total of 335 consecutive patients with 346 invasive and in situ breast cancers were treated with breast conserving therapy. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis were performed and survival rates were calculated and analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: With a median follow-up period of 70.6 months 14 patients (4%) developed an IBTR. Overall survival and the disease-free 8-year actuarial survival of patients were 95% and 93%, respectively. The overall survival of patients with tumour recurrence on any site was significantly shorter than of those without recurrence (64% versus 85% after 8 years of follow-up; P < 0.0001). Similarly, overall survival was significantly reduced in patients with distant metastases compared to all others without distant disease (88% versus 40% after 8 years; P < 0.0001). In contrast, overall survival of patients who experienced IBTR did not differ significantly from the group of patients who never developed IBTR (87% versus 70% after 8 years of follow-up). By univariate analysis, lobular carcinoma, high grade tumours, multifocality, concomitant LCIS and DCIS, the absence of estrogene and progesterone receptor status, as well as R1-status, were significant predictors of IBTR. By multivariate analysis, only R1-status (P < 0.002) and the presence of LCIS around the invasive tumour (P < 0.03) remained as significant factors predicting IBTR. Conclusions: Concomitant lobular carcinomas in situ, as well as R1 surgical status are independent significant risk factors for in breast tumor recurrence after breast conserving therapy.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-008-0187-y

Here, we performed immunohistochemical staining in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 187 cases of primary invasive mammary carcinoma [137 ductal carcinomas (IDC) and 50 lobular carcinomas (ILC)] by using a monoclonal anti-WWP1 antibody. The normal breast epithelium and adjacent benign epithelium are essentially negative for WWP1. Cytoplasmic WWP1 immunoreactivity was observed in 76/187 (40.6%) tumors and showed a positive correlation with ER alpha (p = 0.05) and IGF-1R proteins (p = 0.001) in this cohort. The positive correlations between WWP1 and ER/IGF-1R were also observed in a panel of 12 breast cancer cell lines I)v Western blot. Interestingly, the ER levels are decreased when WWP1 is silenced in ER positive MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines. Finally, WWP1 ablation collectively inhibits cell proliferation with tamoxifen in MCF7 and T47D, as measured by H-3-thymidine incorporation assays. These findings suggest that WWP1 may play an important role in ER positive breast cancer. (C) 2009 UICC														0020-7136		10.1002/ijc.24266

Evidence suggests that the increased risk of breast cancer associated with combined hormone replacement therapy use is higher for invasive lobular cancers (ILC) than for invasive ductal cancers (IDC). This study provides U.S. incidence rates for these histologic types for both in situ and invasive cancers and assesses changes in the incidence of these cancers over time.Methods: Data for this study included incident ductal and lobular breast cancer cases diagnosed from 1999 through 2004 in central cancer registries in 44 states and the District of Columbia from the National Program of Cancer Registries and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. We estimated incidence per 100,000 women by 10-year age groups, race, and ethnicity. We also assessed the percent change in invasive and in situ cancer incidence over time.Results: We observed distinct differences in the change of incidence over time between in situ and invasive lobular and ductal breast cancers. The age-adjusted rates of ILC and IDC declined an average of 4.6% and 3.3% per year, respectively. Overall, ILC decreased 20.5% from 1999 to 2004. The patterns of ductal and lobular in situ cancer incidence were not consistent over time, and the total change was negligible.Conclusion: The declines in ILC observed in our study are consistent with a decrease in cancer incidence related to a reduced use of combined hormone replacement therapy. However, other factors could also be responsible for these changes.

J	BCI:BCI200900383821	19294736			Epigenetic silencing in non-neoplastic epithelia identifies E-cadherin (CDH1) as a target for chemoprevention of lobular neoplasia		Zou, Donghui; Yoon, Han-Seung; Perez, David; Weeks, Robert J.; Guilford, Parry; Humar, Bostjan (bostjan.humar@otago.ac.nz)									Journal of Pathology		2009	JUN 2009	218	2	265-272	265	272							Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) of the breast is believed to develop from in situ lesions, atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Down-regulation of the cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin is a defining feature of lobular breast cancer (LBC) and already occurs in ALH and LCIS. Apart from mutational mechanisms, epigenetic silencing of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) is thought to be involved in E-cadherin down-regulation and has been observed at a high frequency in ILC. Whether CDH1 promoter methylation is already present in in situ lesions and thus contributes to the initiation of LBC is not established. We thus examined microdissected archived tissue from 20 LBCs by methylation-specific PCR to determine the CDH1 methylation status of lobular lesions. Nineteen of the 20 LBCs had a hypermethylated CDH1 promoter, including 13/14 ILCs and 13/13 ALHs or LCIS. Bisulphite sequencing indicated that methylation was complete within the investigated promoter fragment. Intriguingly, CDH1 methylation was likewise present in 8/8 adjacent non-neoplastic epithelia, but not in 6/6 mammary epithelia from healthy subjects. E-cadherin protein and mRNA were down-regulated in in situ lesions relative to adjacent epithelia. Together, these results indicate that CDH1 promoter methylation occurs in LBC prior to E-cadherin down-regulation and neoplastic formation. We thus propose that epigenetic silencing represents the first of the two hits required to silence both CDH1 alleles for LBC to develop. Because promoter methylation is in principle reversible, our findings suggest that chemoprevention of LBC by epigenetic drugs should be feasible. Furthermore, the presence of CDH1 methylation in pre-neoplastic epithelia suggests the existence of mammary regions with increased disease susceptibility, providing an explanation for the often multifocal presentation of LBC.

Cancer		2009	APR 15 2009	115	8	1621-1630	1621	1630							BACKGROUND: Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) of patients with early breast cancer is being investigated on a multi-institutional protocol National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-39/RTOG 0413. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than mammography (MG) and may aid in selection of patients appropriate for PBI. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) routinely undergo contrast-enhanced, bilateral breast MRI at the Cleveland Clinic. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all early-stage breast cancer patients who had a breast MRI, MG, and surgical pathology data at our institution between June of 2005 and December of 2006. Any suspicious lesions identified on MRI were further evaluated by targeted ultrasound biopsy. RESULTS: A total of 260 patients met eligibility criteria for NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 by MG, physical exam, and surgical pathology. The median age was 57 years. DCIS was present in 63 patients, and invasive breast cancer was found in 197 patients. MRI identified suspicious lesions in 35 ipsilateral breasts (13%) and in 16 contralateral breasts (6%). Mammographically occult, synchronous ipsilateral foci were found by MRI in 11 patients (4.2%), and in the contralateral breast in 4 patients (1.5%). By univariate analysis, lobular histology (infiltrating lobular carcinoma [ILC]), pathologic T2, and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 11 were significantly associated with additional ipsilateral disease. Of patients with ILC histology, 18% had ipsilateral secondary cancers or DCIS, compared with 3% in the remainder of histologic subtypes (P = .004). No patient older than 70 years had synchronous cancers or DCIS detected by MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Breast MRI identified synchronous mammographically occult foci in 5.8% of early breast cancer patients who would otherwise be candidates for APBI. Cancer 2009;115:1621-30.

J	BCI:BCI200900301480	19402387			Comparative Genomic Hybridization-Based Oncogenetic Tree Model for Genetic Classification of Breast Cancer		Friedrich, Katrin (katrin.friedrich@uniklinikum-dresden.de) ; von Heydebreck, Anja; Haroske, Gunter; Scheithauer, Jens; Meyer, Wolfdietrich; Kunze, Klaus Dietmar; Baretton, Gustavo									Analytical and Quantitative Cytology and Histology		2009	APR 2009	31	2	101-108	101	108							OBJECTIVE: To describe a genetic progression pathway in breast cancer by a maximum likelihood-based tree model representing the dependencies between chromosomal imbalances.STUDY DESIGN: One hundred six cases were studied by comparative genomic hybridization, followed by maximum likelihood estimation of an oncogenetic tree model.RESULTS: The tree model identified 3 clusters with correlated chromosomal imbalances. The first cluster included losses at 4q, 5q, 6q, 9p, 13q and a gain at 17q; the second cluster included gains at 1q, 8q, 16p and 20q; the third cluster included losses at 8p, 11q, 16q and 18q. The imbalances nearest the root of the tree were the loss at 13q (cluster 1), the gain at 1q (cluster 2) and the loss at 18q (cluster 3), reflecting an early change in breast cancer evolution. Cox regression analysis revealed the tumor stage and the grade as relevant for overall survival (p = 0.001) and the tumor stage, the grade and the loss at 16q as relevant for disease-free survival (p = 0.001).CONCLUSION: Methods like oncogenetic tree analysis provide insights into the genetic progression of breast cancer and may extract relevant markers detected by screening methods like comparative genomic hybridization for further studies.

Glycodelin is expressed in normal glandular epithelium of the endometrium as well as in normal and malignant glandular cells in and outside of the reproductive tract. Recently, Gd expression was demonstrated in normal and cancerous human breast tissue.Paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue blocks (n=121) were examined for Gd expression. No part of the specimens contained carcinoma in situ.Gd expression was present in lobular and ductal breast carcinoma. We observed expression of Gd in breast cancer independent of grading. With regard to nodal status, no significant differences in the expression of Gd between cancer tissue from patients with or without axillary lymph node metastases were present. However, Gd expression was found to be significantly higher in breast cancer tissue when the staining reaction for steroid receptors was also positive.These results implicate that Gd might be an additional marker for the differentiation of breast cancer tissue. To which extent Gd could serve as an additional indicator for breast cancer survival is part of our ongoing research.

Histologically, the tumor was composed of nodular proliferation of biphasic epithelial and myoepithelial carcinoma, partially surrounded by ILC. Interestingly, ILC metastasized to the axillary lymph nodes, while biphasic epithelial and myoepithelial carcinoma hematogenously metastasized to the lung and the kidney. On immunohistochemistry the biphasic carcinoma consisted of cytokeratin (CK) 8/18-positive/CK5/6-positive/smooth muscle actin (SMA)-negative inner carcinoma cells and CK8/18-positive/CK5/6-positive/SMA-positive outer carcinoma cells. The monophasic ILC cells had a CK8/18-positive/CK5/6-negative/SMA-negative staining pattern. Although it is unclear whether both ILC and biphasic epithelial and myoepithelial carcinoma originated from AME or whether ILC occurred independently of malignant AME, this is an exceptionally rare case, which might give rise to a special consideration of the histogenesis of breast cancer.														1320-5463	1440-1827	10.1111/j.1440-1827.2009.02347.x

We retrospectively evaluate outcome of patients with MF/MC cancers who had breast conservation with specific attention on local control and predictive factors of recurrence. Patients and methods Four hundred and seventy six patients with either MF (n = 421) or MC (n = 55) breast cancer, underwent breast-conserving surgery between 1997 and 2002 in a single institution. Median follow up was 73 months (range 11-118). Results Median age was 53 years (range 23-86). Invasive lobular carcinoma was found in 88 patients (18.5%) and mixed ductal-lobular cancer in 27 (5.7%) patients. Two hundred and sixty-seven patients (76.7%) had two identified tumor foci, 55 patients (15.3%) had three and 29 patients (8.0%) had four or more. Two hundred and sixty-one patients (55.3%) had nodal involvement. The 5-year cumulative incidence of local relapse was 5.1%. At the multivariate analysis, over-expression of HER2/neu and lack of both estrogen and progesterone receptors (HR: 3.2, 95% C.I. 1.01-10.0, and HR: 2.7, 95% C.I. 1.06-7.7, respectively) were associated with a higher ipsilateral breast cancer reappearance rate. Involvement of four or more lymph nodes and lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors (HR: 2.7, 95% C.I. 1.06-6.7, and HR: 4.7, 95% C.I. 2.1-10.4, respectively) were associated with poorer overall survival. Conclusions In selected patients with MF/MC breast cancer, wide conservative surgery is not associated with poor local disease control and can be considered whenever acceptable cosmetic results can be achieved.

J	BCI:BCI200900126177	19142182			Economic evaluation of chemoprevention of breast cancer with tamoxifen and raloxifene among high-risk women in Japan		Kondo, M. (mkondo@md.tsukuba.ac.jp) ; Hoshi, S-L; Toi, M.									British Journal of Cancer		2009	JAN 22 2009	100	2	281-290	281	290							Raloxifene was approved for chemoprevention against breast cancer among high-risk women in addition to tamoxifen by the US Food and Drug Administration. This study aims to evaluate cost-effectiveness of these agents under Japan's health system. A cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov model consisting of eight health states such as healthy, invasive breast cancer, and endometrial cancer is carried out. The model incorporated the findings of National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-1 and P-2 trial, and key costs obtained from health insurance claim reviews. Favourable results, that is cost saving or cost-effective, are found by both tamoxifen and raloxifene for the introduction of chemoprevention among extremely high-risk women such as having a history of atypical hyperplasia, a history of lobular carcinoma in situ or a 5-year predicted breast cancer risk of >= 5.01% starting at younger age, whereas unfavourable results, that is 'cost more and gain less' or cost-ineffective, are found for women with a 5-year predicted breast cancer risk of <= 5.00%. Therapeutic policy switch from tamoxifen to raloxifene among postmenopausal women are implied cost-effective. Findings suggest that introduction of chemoprevention targeting extremely high-risk women in Japan can be justifiable as an efficient use of finite health-care resources, possibly contributing to cost containment.														0007-0920	1532-1827	10.1038/sj.bjc.6604869

J	BCI:BCI200900108233	18213475			Loss of expression of chromosome 16q genes DPEP1 and CTCF in lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast		Green, Andrew R. (andrew.green@nottingham.ac.uk) ; Krivinskas, Sophie; Young, Peter; Rakha, Emad A.; Paish, E. Claire; Powe, Desmond G.; Ellis, Ian O.									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2009	JAN 2009	113	1	59-66	59	66							Background Loss of the chromosomal material at 16q is the most frequent genetic event in invasive and in situ (LCIS) lobular carcinoma of the breast. However, the smallest region of overlap at 16q is not restricted to just the CDH1 locus harbouring E-cadherin, suggesting that neighbouring genes might be involved in the development and progression of these tumours. Potential novel tumour suppressor genes (TSG) at 16q include CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), Decreased Expression in Renal and Prostate Cancer (DERPC) and Dipeptidase 1 (DPEP1). The aim of this study is to assess the expression of these genes in LCIS and compare them with normal breast, using CDH1 as a control, in order to evaluate their role as TSGs. Methods Cells from LCIS cases and normal breast lobules were microdissected and expression of target genes were quantified using real-time PCR. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for E-cadherin and CTCF was performed on paraffin processed LCIS (n = 49) and normal breast cases. Results All LCIS showed negative expression of E-cadherin. Similar to CDH1, CTCF and DPEP1 gene expression was significantly lower in LCIS cases compared with normal cases (P < 0.05). CTCF IHC expression showed significant reduction in LCIS compared to normal parenchymal cells. However, there was no difference in expression of DERPC between LCIS and normal breast tissue. Conclusions In addition to CDH1, loss of CTCF and DPEP1 gene expression suggest they are possible TSG in breast cancer and may, similar to CDH1, be potentially utilised as markers of predisposition of women diagnosed with LCIS.

Lobular carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer that metastasizes to the uterus. Case Report: We report on a 56-year-old woman who 3 years previously was diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast and was treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. While the patient was on adjuvant anastrozole therapy for 2 years, she complained of vaginal bleeding. Because of endometrial thickening and a uterine leiomyoma detected during abdominal ultrasonographic examination, a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy was performed. Histopathologic examination of the specimens revealed carcinoma infiltration of the myometrium, endometrium, cervix, uterine tube, and left ovary. Immunohistochemical staining of tumoral cells with pancytokeratin and gross cystic disease fluid protein (GCDFP-15) proved the diagnosis of metastatic lobular breast carcinoma to the uterus. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the second case of lobular breast carcinoma metastasized to the uterus under anastrozole therapy. In women with lobular breast cancer under adjuvant anastrozole therapy, who present with vaginal bleeding, uterine metastasis of lobular carcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis.														0378-584X		10.1159/000218367																		
J	BCI:BCI200900081203	19089736			Columnar cell lesions of the breast: an update and significance on core biopsy		Jara-Lazaro, Ana Richelia; Tse, Gary Man-Kit; Tan, Puay Hoon (tan.puay.hoon@sgh.com.sg)									Pathology		2009		41	1	18-27	18	27							Columnar cell lesions of the breast refer to the morphological spectrum of alterations of the epithelial lining of variably dilated acini of the terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU), often related to secretions and calcifications. After decades of varied terminologies, the term of 'flat epithelial atypia' by the World Health Organization (WHO) consensus group encompasses the part of the spectrum where columnar cell change or columnar cell hyperplasia acquires low grade cytological atypia, merging with atypical ductal hyperplasia and low grade ductal carcinoma in situ. Its association with low grade invasive carcinoma and lobular neoplasia, whether by proximity to these lesions, or by similar molecular expressions, has prompted greater scrutiny into its clinical significance.Although recent literature attempts to refine the term 'flat epithelial atypia', the applicability of its morphological criteria in routine diagnostic practice remains to be seen, and interobserver variability is highly possible. This poses even greater challenges especially in limited samples of breast tissue, such as in core biopsies, for pre-operative decision-making.The purpose of this review is to elucidate evolving clinical and diagnostically relevant principles that surround and influence the significance of this still controversial entity, especially when discovered on core biopsy in the initial phase of breast diagnosis and management.														0031-3025		10.1080/00313020802563486

Recent molecular genetic information on this entity, however, has provided additional insights into the biology of this incompletely understood disease. Recognition of variants of lobular carcinoma in situ has also led to dilemmas in optimal management, and the advent of pre-operative core biopsies for radiologically detected lesions has created uncertainties regarding how best to handle incidentally discovered lobular neoplasia on these biopsy cores. This article provides an overview of existing concepts, diagnostic pitfalls, pathobiology and current management approaches for this enigmatic lesion.														0031-3025	1465-3931	10.1080/00313020802563494

Our objective was to evaluate the MammoSite device performances after an open cavity placement procedure and quality of life in highly selected patients with early-stage breast cancer.Methods and materials: From March 2003 to March 2005,43 patients with T1 breast cancer were enrolled in a phase 11 study. The median age was 72 years. Twenty-five (58%) patients were treated with high-close rate brachytherapy using the MammoSite applicator to deliver 34 Gy in 10 fractions. The main disqualifying factor was pathologic sentinel node involvement (10143; 23%). There were no device malfunctions, migration or rupture of the balloon.Results: After a median follow-up of 13 months, there were no local recurrences and one contralateral lobular carcinoma. Seventeen (68%),13 (5214 8 (32%). 5 (20%) and 2 (8%) patients had erythema, seroma, inflammation, hematoma and sever infection, respectively. Only 2 patients developed telangiectasia. At 1 year the rate of "good to excellent" cosmetic results was 84%. Significant changes in QoL were observed for emotional and social well-being between 3 and 12 months. At 24 months, only emotional well-being subscore changes were statistically significant (p = 0.015).Conclusions: Our data in patients older than 60 years Support the previously published data. Histologic features were the main disqualifying criteria. With higher skin spacing levels we observed very low incidence of telangiectasia. QoL evaluation indicates that baseline scores were satisfactory, Changes concerned emotional and social well-being. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Lawrence (larry.wickerham@nsabp.org) ; Costantino, Joseph P.; Vogel, Victor G.; Cronin, Walter M.; Cecchini, Reena S.; Ford, Leslie G.; Wolmark, Norman			Senn, HJ; Kapp, U; Otto, F						Recent Results in Cancer Research	RECENT RESULTS IN CANCER RESEARCH	2009		181		113-119	113	119							The NSABP Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR). launched in 1999, compared tamoxifen with raloxifene in a population of healthy postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer to determine the relative effects on the risk of invasive breast cancer. To be eligible for participation, a woman had to be healthy with at least a 5-year predicted breast cancer risk of 1.66'% based on the Gail model or a history of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) treated by local excision alone. All participants were at least 35 years of age and postmenopausal. Between July 1999 and November 2004, 19,747 participants were randomized to receive either tamoxifen (20 mg, plus placebo) or raloxifene (60 mg, plus placebo) daily for a 5-year period. The mean age of the participants was 58.5 years; 93% were white and 51.6% had a hysterectomy prior to entering the study. Of the women, 71% had one or more first degree female relatives (mother, sister, daughter) with a history of breast cancer and 9.2% of the women had a personal history of LCIS. A history of atypical hyperplasia of the breast was noted in 22.7% of the participants. The mean predicted 5-year risk of developing breast cancer among the study population was 4.03% (SD, 2.17%) with a lifetime predicted risk of 16%. The mean tune of follow-up is 3.9 years (SD, 1.6 years). There was no difference between the effect of tamoxifen and the effect of raloxifene on the incidence of invasive breast cancer; there were 163 cases of invasive breast cancer in the tamoxifen-treated group and 168 cases in those women assigned to raloxifene (incidence 4.30 per 1,000 vs 4.41 per 1,000; RR 1.02; 95% Cl, 082-1.28). There were fewer cases of noninvasive breast cancer (LCIS and ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]) in the tamoxifen group (57 cases) than in the raloxifene group (80 cases), although the difference is not yet statistically significant (incidence 1.51 vs 2.11 per 1,000; RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.98-2.00). There were 36 cases of uterine cancer with tamoxifen and 23 cases with raloxifene (RR, 0.63; 95%) CI, 0.35-1.08).

Iss. SI	2742-2752	2742	2752							Introduction: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been increasingly utilized to screen and manage breast care. As the literature demonstrating its benefit expands, so do the potential clinical indications. However, routine review of the literature is merited to re-evaluate the appropriate and cost-effective use of MRI and guide clinicians in the areas of controversy.Methods: A literature review was performed to evaluate the current evidence for the use of MRI.Results: Evidence supports MRI screening for genetic mutation carriers and for those with an equivalent lifetime risk (> 50%). Regarding staging and management, MRI is indicated for monitoring tumour response to neoadjuvant therapy. MRI should also be considered for patients with invasive lobular carcinoma, mammographically occult breast cancer and Paget's disease.Discussion: Though MRI is limited by moderate specificity and high cost, it can be a valuable, sensitive and cost-effective tool with thoughtful and judicious patient selection.

J	BCI:BCI200900012223	18990752			Migraine in Postmenopausal Women and the Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer		Mathes, Robert W. (rmathes@u.washington.edu) ; Malone, Kathleen E.; Daling, Janet R.; Davis, Scott; Lucas, Sylvia M.; Porter, Peggy L.; Li, Christopher I.									Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention		2008	NOV 2008	17	11	3116-3122	3116	3122							Background: The frequency of migraine headache changes at various times of a woman's reproductive cycle. Menarche, menses, pregnancy, and perimenopause may carry a different migraine risk conceivably because of fluctuating estrogen levels, and in general, migraine frequency is associated with falling estrogen levels. Given the strong relationship between endogenous estrogen levels and breast cancer risk, migraine sufferers may experience a reduced risk of breast cancer.Methods: We combined data from two population-based case-control studies to examine the relationship between migraine and risk of postmenopausal invasive breast cancer among 1,199 ductal carcinoma cases, 739 lobular carcinoma cases, and 1,474 controls 55 to 79 years of age. Polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Results: Women who reported a clinical diagnosis of migraine had reduced risks of ductal carcinoma (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54-0.82) and lobular carcinoma (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52-0.90). These associations were primarily limited to hormone receptor-positive tumors as migraine was associated with a 0.65-fold (95% CI, 0.51-0.83) reduced risk of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/progesterone receptor-positive (PR+) ductal carcinoma. The reductions in risk observed were seen among migraine sufferers who did and did not use prescription medications for their migraines.Conclusions: These data suggest that a history of migraine is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, particularly among ER+/PR+ ductal and lobular carcinomas. Because this is the first study to address an association between migraine history and breast cancer risk, additional studies are needed to confirm this finding.

Although invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common histotype of breast cancer, the prognostic implications of its clinicopathologic characteristics remain controversial.METHODS. The authors undertook a retrospective analysis of a large series of cases treated and followed at a single institution, with the objective of assessing the prognostic/predictive value of distinct clinicopathologic features of the tumors, after revision of the original histopathologic preparations and statistical analyses.RESULTS. Overall, 530 patients with pure ILC (57% with the classic type; 19% with the alveolar type; 11% with the solid type; and the remaining 13% characterized by pleomorphic, signet ring cell, histiocytoid, or apocrine features) were included in the study. Tumor size, lymph node metastatic involvement, and hormonal status were confirmed to be significant prognostic factors. In addition, statistically significant correlations were demonstrated between the 'classic' histotype of ILC and a lower risk of axillary lymph node metastases (P =.0005), a reduced number of metastatic lymph nodes (P =.04), and lower tumor grade (P <.0001). Patients with ILC of the 'nonclassic' subtype demonstrated significantly increased breast-related events (hazards ratio of 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.10) and a trend toward reduced disease-free survival and overall survival.CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current Study confirm the clinical usefulness of several traditional clinicopathologic features of ILC as prognostic parameters but also emphasize the prognostic role of the histopathologic subtyping of these tumors, documenting the more favorable outcome of the classic subtype of ILC.			maisonneuve, patrick/U-9789-2018; Maiorano, Eugenio/F-1382-2015	maisonneuve, patrick/0000-0002-5309-4704; Maiorano, Eugenio/0000-0002-0472-5338										0008-543X		10.1002/cncr.23811

The aim of our study was to define morphologic features of lobular neoplasia in core biopsies that predict the finding of ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma in the subsequent excisional specimen. We reviewed 333 cases of atypical lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ without ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma diagnosed in core biopsies from 1996 to 2006. Subsequent excision was performed in 41% (136/333) of cases, including atypical lobular hyperplasia (n = 48), lobular carcinoma in situ (n = 39), and lobular neoplasia associated with atypical ductal hyperplasia (n = 49). Upgrades were identified in 2% (1/48) of atypical lobular hyperplasia, 23% (9/39) of lobular carcinoma in situ, and 27% (13/49) of lobular neoplasia associated with atypical ductal hyperplasia cases. When further analyzed, the upgraded cases of lobular carcinoma in situ were associated with radiologic-pathologic discordance in 6/9 cases and with nonclassic pathology (two lobular carcinoma in situ with necrosis and one pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ) in the remaining three cases. The frequency of upgrade was 11% (3/26) in classic lobular carcinoma in situ, and 46% (6/13) in nonclassic types ( pleomorphic or with necrosis). After excluding cases with discordant imaging/pathology, there was a 5% upgrade in our excisional specimens. After excluding cases where the upgrade was associated with nonclassic morphology, the upgrade in our study was 1%. Our results suggest that atypical lobular hyperplasia and classic lobular carcinoma in situ with concordant radiology and pathology can be appropriately managed with clinical follow-up without surgery.														0893-3952		10.1038/modpathol.2008.134

Methods Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptive polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze the mRNA expression levels of the three genes in tumor tissues from 60 patients with primary breast cancer and normal breast tissues of 30 cases. The relationship between gene expression and clinicopathological factors were analyzed and determined. Results The relative expression levels (gray scale ratio between target gene and internal reference gene) of Fas, CTLA-4 and RhoBTB2 genes in breast carcinoma tissues were 0.699 +/- 0.285, 1.045 +/- 0.302 and 0.625 +/- 0.160, respectively. In the normal breast tissues, they were 0.502 +/- 0.178, 0.418 +/- 0.140 and 0.843 +/- 0.218, respectively. There were statistically significant differences of the expression of those three genes between carcinoma tissues and normal breast tissues (P<0.01). The expression level of Fas in carcinoma tissues was significantly higher in lymph node matastasis positive patients (0.782 +/- 0.313) than that in node-negative patients (0.557 +/- 0.146, P<0.01). The expression level of CTLA-4 gene in carcinoma tissues was lower in II stage patients (0.978 +/- 0.330)than that in III stage patients (1.134 +/- 0.240, P<0.05). The expression level of RhoBTB2 gene was lower in invasive ductal carcinoma (0.597 +/- 0.157) than that in invasive lobular carcinoma (0.717 +/- 0.145, P<0.05). There were no correlations of expression of the three genes at mRNA level and age, ER, PR, HER2 status and survival time. Furthermore, no correlation was seen among the three genes expression (P>0.05). Conclusion The expression of all the three genes at mRNA level is involved in genesis and progression of breast cancer. There exist correlations between Fas expression and axillary lymph node matastasis, CTLA-4 expression and disease stage, and RhoBTB2 expression and pathological type of breast cancer.														0253-3766

Epidemiological and histoclinical data suggest biological differences, but little is known about the molecular alterations involved in ILCs. We undertook a comparative large-scale study by both array-compared genomic hybridization and cDNA microarray of a set of 50 breast tumors (21 classic ILCs and 29 IDCs) selected on homogeneous histoclinical criteria. Results were validated on independent tumor sets, as well as by quantitative RT-PCR. ILCs and IDCs presented differences at both the genomic and expression levels with ILCs being less rearranged and heterogeneous than IDCs. Supervised analysis defined a 75-BACs signature discriminating accurately ILCs from IDCs. Expression profiles identified two subgroups of ILCs: typical ILCs (similar to 50%), which were homogeneous and displayed a normal-like molecular pattern, and atypical ILCs, more heterogeneous with features intermediate between ILCs and IDCs. Supervised analysis identified a 75-gene expression signature that discriminated ILCs from IDCs, with many genes involved in cell adhesion, motility, apoptosis, protein folding, extracellular matrix and protein phosphorylation. Although ILCs and IDCs share common alterations, our data show that ILCs and IDCs could be distinguished on the basis of their genomic and expression profiles suggesting that they evolve along distinct genetic pathways.

S.; Ellis, Ian O. (ian.ellis@nottingham.ac.uk)									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2008	SEP 2008	111	1	121-127	121	127							Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) comprises approximately 5-15% of breast cancers and appears to have a distinct biology. As it is less common than invasive ductal carcinoma, few studies of large size have addressed the value of assessment of histologic grade in ILC. Methods: This study is based on a large and well-characterised consecutive series of breast cancer (4,987 cases), from a single institution, with a long-term follow-up to assess the prognostic value of routine assessment of histologic grade in ILC. Histologic grade and other clinicopathological data were available in 517 pure ILC cases. A panel of biomarkers was also available for 215 cases. Results: The majority of ILC was of classical and mixed lobular variants (89%). Most ILC cases were moderately differentiated (grade 2) tumours (76%), while a small proportion of tumours were either grade 1 or 3 tumours (12% each). There were positive associations between histologic grade and other clinicopathological variables of poor prognosis such as larger size, positive lymph node, vascular invasion, oestrogen receptor and androgen receptor negativity and p53 positivity. Multivariate analyses showed that histologic grade is an independent predictor of shorter breast cancer specific survival and disease free interval. Conclusion: Histologic grade of ILC, as assessed by the Nottingham grading system, provides a strong predictor of outcome in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast and should be provided routinely in pathology reports.

It is therefore necessary to examine thoroughly whether there is any other carcinoma present before any breast-conserving surgery is carried out. We cytologically, histologically, and ultrastructurally investigated ILC and pure scirrhous carcinoma (PSC), a subtype of invasive ductal carcinoma, to establish cytological diagnostic criteria for the differential diagnosis of these two types of carcinoma that have high histological similarity. Cytologically, ILC cells showed linear or isolated cell arrangements and had small nuclei with round homogeneously distributed fine granular chromatin. The cytoplasm was light, and individual cells lacked cohesion. The carcinoma showed a rosary-like configuration. PSC cells, however, showed linear or cordlike arrangements. Individual cells showed a vertical arrangement. PSC cells had a linear cytoplasmic edge and were characterized by nuclear molding with coarse granular chromatin. These cytological findings were supported by histological and ultrastructural findings. These findings may contribute to histological estimation of ILC in preoperative cytological diagnosis.														1860-1480	1860-1499	10.1007/s00795-008-0408-9

(james.b.yu@yale.edu) ; Wilson, Lynn D.; Dasgupta, Tina; Castrucci, William A.; Weidhaas, Joanne B.									Cancer		2008	JUL 1 2008	113	1	38-47	38	47							BACKGROUND. The role of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) for lymph node-negative locally advanced breast carcinoma (T3N0M0) after modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with regard to improvement in survival remains an area of controversy.METHODS. The 1973-2004 National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was examined for patients with T3N0M0 ductal, lobular, or mixed ductal and lobular carcinoma of the breast who underwent MRM, treated from 1988-2003. Patients who were men, who had positive lymph nodes, who survived <= 6 months, for whom breast cancer was not the first malignancy, who had nonbeam radiation, intraoperative or preoperative radiation were excluded. The average treatment effect of PMRT on mortality was estimated with a propensity score case-matched analysis.RESULTS. In all, 1777 patients were identified; 568 (32%) patients received PMRT. Median tumor size was 6.3 cm. The median number of lymph nodes examined was 14 (range, 1-49). Propensity score matched case-control analysis showed no improvement in overall survival with the delivery of PMRT in this group. Older patients, patients with ER- disease (compared with ER+), and patients with high-grade tumors (compared with well differentiated) had increased mortality.CONCLUSIONS. The use of PMRT for T3N0M0 breast carcinoma after MRM is not associated with an increase in overall survival. It was not possible to analyze local control in this study given the limitations of the SEER database. The impact of potential improvement in local control as it relates to overall survival should be the subject of further investigation.

Our study evaluates the use of cytokeratin immunohistochemistry in detecting sentinel lymph node metastases and its effect on staging patients with invasive lobular carcinoma. Material from 76 patients with invasive lobular carcinoma was reviewed. Cytokeratin immunostaining was performed on negative nodes, and deposits were classified as macrometastasis (> 2.0 mm), micrometastasis (> 0.2-2 mm), or isolated tumor cells (<= 0.2 mm). Of 76 cases, 24 (21 macro- and 3 micrometastases, 32%) were positive for metastasis and 14 (18%) for isolated tumor cells. immunohistochemistry was needed for all cases with isolated tumor cells and 1case of micrometastasis. Criteria to distinguish isolated tumor cells and micrometastasis need to be better defined. In our study, immunostaining changed nodal status and stage in 1 of 52 (2%) node-negative patients. Immunohistochemistry is essential to detect isolated tumor cells in sentinel lymph nodes. However, for detecting micro- or macrometastases, it does not provide any significant advantage over detailed histopathological evaluation of sentinel lymph node. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

(p.simpson@uq.edu.cu) ; Rels-Filho, J. S.; Lambros, M. B. K.; Jones, C.; Steele, D.; Mackay, A.; Iravani, M.; Fenwick, K.; Dexter, T.; Jones, A.; Reid, L.; Da Silva, L.; Shin, S.

Journal of Pathology		2008	JUL 2008	215	3	231-244	231	244							Pleomorphic lobular carcinomas (PLC) of the breast display histological features associated with classic invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), yet they also exhibit more conspicuous nuclear atypia and pleomorphism, and an aggressive clinical behaviour. From a breast cancer progression perspective, it is unclear whether PLC is a variant of ILC or is a high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) that has lost E-cadherin. The molecular features of 26 PLC were studied using immunohistochemistry [oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, p53 and E-cadherin], 0.9 Mb resolution, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), fluorescent (FISH) and chromogenic (CISH) in situ hybridization and loss of heterozygosity. Comparative analysis was performed with aCGH data from PLC with classic ILC (16 cases) and high grade IDC (35 cases). PLCs were frequently ER- and PR-positive, E-cadherin-negative and occasionally HER2-and p53-positive. Recurrent copy number changes identified by aCGH included gains on 1q, 8q, 11q, 12q, 16p and 17q and losses on 8p, 11q, 13q, 16q and Xq. Highly recurrent 1q+ (100% of cases), 16p+ (93%), 11q- (53%) and 16q- (93%) and evidence of the der(1;16)/der(16)t(1;16) rearrangement, as detected by FISH, suggested that PLC had a 'lobular genotype'. Focal amplifications were evident at 8p12-p11, 8q24, 11q13.1-q14.1, 12q14,17q12 and 20q13. Loss of BRCA2 was detected in 40% of PLC by LOH. Comparative analysis of aCGH data suggested the molecular features of PLC (ER/PR-positive, E-cad herin-negative, 1q(+), 11q(-), 16p(+) and 16q(-)) were more closely related to those of ILC than IDC, implicating an overlapping developmental pathway for these lobular tumour types. Molecular alterations found in PLC that are more typical of high-grade IDC than ILC (p53 and HER2 positivity, 8q(+), 17q24-q25(+), 13q(-) and amplification of 8q24, 12q14, 17q12 and 20q13) are likely to drive the high-grade and more aggressive biology of PLC.

We report a case of lobular carcinoma with metastasis to an endometrial polyp in a patient with no history of tamoxifen therapy. The histological features of the polyp in our case closely mimicked those of tamoxifen-related polyps, emphasizing the fact that - although characteristic - these features are not specific for tamoxifen. This case also reiterates the need for careful evaluation of endometrial polyps, since inconspicuous deposits of lobular carcinoma can easily be missed.														0903-4641		10.1111/j.1600-0463.2008.00940.x

Fifty-one breast tumors were profiled for copy number alterations (CNAs) with the high-resolution Affymetrix 500K SNP array. These tumors were also expression-profiled and surveyed for mutations in selected genes commonly mutated in breast cancer (TP53, CDKN2A, ERBB2, KRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN). Combined analysis of common CNAs and mutations revealed putative associations between features. Analysis of both the prevalence and amplitude of CNAs defined regions of recurrent alteration. Compared with previous array comparative genomic hybridization studies, our analysis provided boundaries for frequently altered regions that were approximately one-fourth the size, greatly reducing the number of potential alteration-driving genes. Expression data from matched tumor samples were used to further interrogate the functional relevance of genes located in recurrent amplicons. Although our data support the importance of some known driver genes such as ERBB2, refined amplicon boundaries at other locations, such as 8p11-12 and 11q13.5-q14.2, greatly reduce the number of potential driver genes and indicate alternatives to commonly suggested driver genes in some cases. For example, the previously reported recurrent amplification at 17q23.2 is reduced to a 249 kb minimal region containing the putative driver RPS6KB1 as well as the putative oncogenic microRNA mir-21. High-resolution copy number analysis provides refined insight into many breast cancer amplicons and their relationships to gene expression, point mutations and breast cancer subtype classifications.

In its initial phase, the spatial pattern of malignant transformation may be lobar (targeting the entire lobe), segmental (targeting a segment) or terminal (targeting distant terminal ductal-lobular units) within the sick lobe. All these variations are properly characterized by the following parameters: the extent of the disease (the volume of the tissue containing all the actually present malignant structures within the breast), the distribution of the lesions within this tissue (unifocal, multifocal or diffuse, separately for in situ and invasive component), the size of the tumor (corresponding to the largest diameter of the largest invasive focus) and the exact localization of the lesion(s). In addition, intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity have to be noticed, if evident. Combining the results of different imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging) the radiologist may compensate the limitations of individual methods. This multimodality approach leads to more accurate radiological size measurement, more accurate assessment of the distribution of the lesions and disease extent. This represents a challenge for pathologists as the traditional histopathology method based on fragmentation and sampling of macroscopically suspicious lesion(s) is clearly insufficient for modern postoperative radiological-pathological correlation. There is a clear need for more complete examination of the excised tissue and for a three-dimensional reconstruction of the finding, preferably using continuous large tissue slices and two and three-dimensional large-format histological sections. Discordant results may still appear as a consequence of failure in radiological-pathological correlation or related to certain tumor subtypes as invasive lobular carcinoma of diffuse type, low grade in situ lesions or micropapillary ductal in situ carcinoma.														1219-4956		10.1007/s12253-008-9061-9																		
J	BCI:BCI200800357069	18348299			Lobular neoplasia on core needle biopsy does not require excision		Nagi, Chandandeep S. (nagic01@yahoo.com) ; O'Donnell, James E.; Tismenetsky, Mikhail; Bleiweiss, Ira J.; Jaffer, Shabnam M.									Cancer		2008	MAY 15 2008	112	10	2152-2158	2152	2158							BACKGROUND. Lobular neoplasia (LN), encompassing atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), is often an incidental finding on core needle biopsies (CNBs) performed in instances of radiologic densities and/or calcifications. Because LN is generally considered a risk factor for breast carcinoma, the utility of subsequent excision is controversial.METHODS. The authors' database yielded 98 cases of LCIS and/or ALH. Cases containing LN accompanied by a second lesion mandating excision (eg, radial scar, atypical ductal hyperplasia [ADH]) and those failing to meet strict diagnostic criteria for LN (eg, atypical cells, mitoses, single-cell necrosis) were excluded. Radiographic calcifications were correlated with their histologic counterparts in terms of size, number, and pattern.RESULTS. Ninety-one biopsies were performed for calcifications and 7 were performed for mass lesions. The ages of the patients ranged from 35 to 82 years. Fifty-three patients were followed radiologically without excision, 42 of whom had available clinicoradiologic information. The 45 patients who under-went excision were without disease at follow-up periods ranging from I to 8 years. Of these 45 patients, 42 (93%) had biopsy results demonstrating only LN. The remaining 3 patients had biopsies with the following findings: ADH in 1 biopsy, residual LCIS and a separate minute focus of infiltrating lobular carcinoma (clearly an incidental finding) in the second biopsy, and ductal carcinoma in situ admixed with LCIS in the third biopsy (a retrospective examination performed by 2 blinded breast pathologists revealed foci of atypical cells and mitoses).CONCLUSIONS. Excision of LN is unnecessary provided that: 1) careful radiographic- pathologic correlation is performed; and 2) strict histologic criteria are adhered to when making the diagnosis. Close radiologic and clinical follow-up is adequate.														0008-543X		10.1002/cncr.23415

One haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slide of each case was analysed on a first round and one H&E slide with corresponding CK5/6 and E-cadherin immunohistochemistry was analysed on a second round. Interobserver reproducibility for category-specific and management-specific lesions was measured on each round. CK5/6 and E-cadherin had little impact on diagnostic agreement, which remained moderate between the first and second rounds (overall kappa coefficients of 0.47 and 0.53, respectively, P = NS). Levels of agreement slightly improved for lesions with specific CK5/6 and E-cadherin immunoprofiles (usual ductal hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, non-high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ), but the differences observed were not statistically significant. However, diagnostic agreement improved when lesions were grouped according to their management category (overall kappa coefficients of 0.58 and 0.66 in the first and second rounds, respectively).Conclusions: CK5/6 and E-cadherin immunohistochemistry has little impact on interobserver reproducibility for non-invasive breast lesions. Diagnostic agreement can, however, be improved by grouping lesions in management categories.

International Journal of Molecular Medicine		2008	MAY 2008	21	5	561-568	561	568							The current hypothesis of tumorigenesis in humans suggests that cancer cells acquire their hallmarks of malignancy through the accumulation of advantageous gene activation and inactivation events over long periods of time. For breast cancer development, this multistep process may manifest itself as a sequence of pathologically defined stages. It is widely held that breast cancer originates at the premalignant stage of atypical ductal hyperplasia, progresses to the preinvasive stage of ductal carcinoma in situ, and culminates in the potentially lethal stage of invasive ductal carcinoma. Tumor grade has been a highly valuable prognostic factor for breast cancer, and high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ lesions are associated with poor clinical outcome. The aim of this work was to investigate the BigH3 protein expression changes associated with various stages of breast cancer progression in comparison to benign specimens using tissue microarray technology. Pathological characteristics of breast tissues ranged from benign lesions to breast cancers either of lobular or ductal carcinomas in origin, and included in situ ductal carcinomas, lobular carcinomas, infiltrating ductal carcinomas, carcinomas, scirrhous carcinomas, adenocarcinomas and infiltrating colloid carcinomas. BigH3 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 192 cases of breast tumors. Results indicated a decrease in BigH3 protein expression from benign tissues to in situ ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, infiltrating ductal carcinomas, carcinomas, scirrhous carcinoma, adenocarcinomas to infiltrating colloid carcinomas. We observed that the benign tissue had a 23-fold increase in BigH3 protein expression compared to the infiltrating colloid carcinoma which was the most malignant tissue analyzed. In summary, these studies confirmed the suppressor effect of the BigH3 gene expressed as protein expression in those processes related to the progression of breast tumorigenesis. We conclude that this protein can be used as a marker for breast cancer progression.														1107-3756

H. S. (andrew.lee@nuh.nhs.uk)									Virchows Archiv		2008	MAY 2008	452	5	473-479	473	479							The management of a core biopsy diagnosis of lobular neoplasia is controversial. Detailed radiological-pathological review of 47 patients with cores showing classical lobular neoplasia was performed (patients with pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or associated risk lesions were considered separately). Immediate surgical excision in 25 patients showed invasive carcinoma in 7, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in 1 and pleomorphic LCIS in 1; radiological-pathological review showed that the core biopsy missed a mass in 5, missed calcification in 2 and that calcification appeared adequately sampled in 2. Nineteen patients had follow-up of at least 2 years. Four patients developed malignancy at the site of the core biopsy (invasive carcinoma in three, DCIS in one); one carcinoma was mammographically occult, one patient had dense original mammograms and two had calcifications apparently adequately sampled by the core. In conclusion, most carcinomas identified at the site of core biopsy showing lobular neoplasia were the result of the core missing the radiological lesion, emphasising the importance of multidisciplinary review and investigation of any discordance. Some carcinomas were found after apparently adequate core biopsy, raising the question of whether excision biopsy should be considered after all core biopsy diagnoses of lobular neoplasia.

Fine-needle aspiration generally produces results that are not as good for lobular carcinoma as the results for ductal carcinoma of the breast. In this study, the authors evaluated their team's performance in cytologic diagnosis of lobular carcinoma over 11 years and analyzed the reasons for diagnostic failure.METHODS. Cytologic findings were analyzed in 555 consecutive fine-needle cytopuncture specimens from women with palpable, invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. The authors also examined the influence of the cytologist's experience, the clinical tumor size, the histologic subtype, and the histologic grade on diagnostic performance. All negative samples were re-examined, along with all samples that had been obtained during the last year of the study, to refine the morphologic description of lobular carcinoma.RESULTS. Malignancy was diagnosed in 68.8% of specimens overall. The individual pathologists diagnosed malignancy in from 44.4% to 81.1% of specimens, depending on their experience. Diagnostic performance was correlated with clinical tumor size, histologic grade, and histologic subtype, and correct diagnoses were significantly more frequent in pleomorphic subtypes than in "classic" types. Re-examination of all 32 negative specimens reduced the false-negative rate from 5.8% to 3.8%.CONCLUSIONS. Despite the pitfalls associated with lobular carcinoma of the breast, fine-needle cytopuncture remains a useful diagnostic tool before treatment. Failures can be reduced through experience and by better knowledge of cytologic features.														0008-543X		10.1002/cncr.23347

FASEB Journal		2008	APR 2008	22											Leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF), a member of the POK family, has a vital function in cellular transformation. Apart from its role in lymphomas, very little is known about its expression in most solid tumors, including breast carcinoma. In this study, LRF mRNA transcripts and protein expression was quantified in benign and malignant breast, colon, liver, lung, renal, and mesothelioma tissues by performing RT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunocytochemistry. All malignant breast tissues expressed significantly more LRF mRNA transcripts and protein than the benign breast tissues. LRF was expressed more strongly in fibroadenoma, invasive lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ than in other breast diseases. The ducts in ductal hyperplasia tissues of the breast were weakly positive. In general, a significantly higher expression of LRF was seen in malignant tissue than in the corresponding benign or normal tissue. LRF expression in the carcinoma of the colon, liver, and lung was higher than in the corresponding normal or benign tissues. A strong expression of LRF was observed in normal prostate but not in prostate cancer. These data suggest that LRF could be a marker for malignancy or proliferation of the cancers.														0892-6638	1530-6860

LVI is infrequently encountered in invasive lobular carcinoma when compared to invasive ductal carcinoma. We employed D2-40 antibody, a novel marker for lymphatic endothelial cells, in an attempt to enhance the detection of LVI in invasive lobular carcinomas. We identified 78 patients with invasive lobular carcinoma with known axillary status, who were studied between 2003 and 2006. D2-40 antibody was applied to one representative paraffin block from each case and the results were compared to LVI on routine histology. LVI was identified in 12 (15%) and 19 (24%) cases by routine histology and D2-40 antibody, respectively. Eleven of 12 patients (92%) with LVI identified by routine histology had axillary nodal metastasis compared to 14 of 19 patients (74%) with LVI identified by D2-40 antibody. LVI was missed by routine histology in 8 cases (10%). D2-40 antibody enhanced the identification of LVI by 9% in node negative patients. D2-40 antibody increased the identification of LVI by 12% in classic invasive lobular carcinoma. In conclusion, D2-40 antibody staining may be useful as an adjunct in detecting LVI in invasive lobular carcinoma, especially in node-negative patients with the classic variant of invasive lobular carcinoma.

This study aims to compare the outcome of lobular vs ductal carcinomas after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Between 1989 and 1999, 750 patients with clinical stage II/IIIA ductal (672) or lobular (78) invasive breast carcinomas were treated at the Institut Curie with primary anthracycline-based polychemotherapy followed by either breast conservation (surgery and/or radiotherapy) or mastectomy. Median follow-up was 10 years. Clinical response to primary chemotherapy was significantly worse for lobular than for ductal carcinomas (47 vs 60%; P = 0.04), but only histological grade remained predictive in multivariate analysis. Breast conservation was high for both ductal and lobular carcinomas (65 and 54%; P = 0.07), due, in part, to the use of radiotherapy, either exclusive or preoperative, for respectively 26 and 40% of patients. The lobular type had no adverse effect, neither on locoregional control nor on overall survival, even in the group of patients treated with breast conservation.														0007-0920	1532-1827	10.1038/sj.bjc.6604229

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed as the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of ILC. Small studies addressing different aspects of MRI in ILC have been presented but no large series to date. To address the usefulness of MRI in the work-up of ILC, we performed a review of the currently published literature.Materials and methods: We performed a literature search using the query "lobular AND (MRI OR MR OR MRT OR magnetic)" in the Cochrane library, PubMed and scholar.google.com, to retrieve all articles that dealt with the use of MRI in patients with ILC. We addressed sensitivity, morphologic appearance, correlation with pathology, detection of additional lesions, and impact of MRI on surgery as different endpoints. Whenever possible we performed meta-analysis of the pooled data.Results: Sensitivity is 93.3% and equal to overall sensitivity of MRI for malignancy in the breast. Morphologic appearance is highly heterogeneous and probably heavily influenced by interreader variability. Correlation with pathology ranges from 0.81 to 0.97; overestimation of lesion size occurs but is rare. In 32% of patients, additional ipsilateral lesions are detected and in 7% contralateral lesions are only detected by MRI. Consequently, MRI induces change in surgical management in 28.3% of cases.Conclusion: This analysis indicates MRI to be valuable in the work-up of ILC.

(cili@fhcrc.org) ; Malone, Kathleen E.; Porter, Peggy L.; Lawton, Thomas J.; Voigt, Lynda F.; Cushing-Haugen, Kara L.; Lin, Ming Gang; Yuan, Xiaopu; Daling, Janet R.									Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention		2008	JAN 2008	17	1	43-50	43	50							Combined estrogen and progestin hormone therapy (CHT) increases breast cancer risk, but this risk varies by breast cancer type. Several studies indicate that CHT is more strongly related to lobular carcinoma risk than to ductal carcinoma risk, but these studies have been limited in their assessments of recency and duration of use, and none included a centralized pathology review. We conducted a population-based case-control study consisting of 324 lobular, 196 ductal-lobular, and 524 ductal cases diagnosed from 2000 to 2004 and 469 controls ages 55 to 74 years old. Tissue specimens were centrally reviewed for 83% of cases. Associations between hormone use and breast cancer risk were evaluated using polytomous logistic regression. Current CHT users had 2.7-fold [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.7-4.21 and 3.3-fold (95% CI, 2.0-5.7) elevated risks of lobular and ductal-lobular carcinomas, respectively, regardless of tumor stage, size, or nodal status. Elevations in risk were observed only among users of CHT for >= 3 years. Among ductal-lobular cases, CHT increased risk of tumors that were >= 50% lobular (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.1-11.1) but not tumors that were < 50% lobular (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.9-4.1). Current CHT users for >= 3 years have a substantially increased risk of lobular carcinomas. Although lobular carcinomas are less common than ductal carcinomas(similar to 16% versus 70% of all invasive breast cancers in the United States), this duration is shorter than the 5 years of use widely cited to be needed to confer an increased risk of breast cancer overall. Further studies focusing on the etiology of lobular carcinomas are needed.														1055-9965		10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-0558

R.; Blamey, Roger; Gee, Julia; Nicholson, Robert I.; Lee, Andrew H. S.; Ellis, Ian O. (ian.ellis@nottingham.ac.uk)									European Journal of Cancer		2008	JAN 2008	44	1	73-83	73	83							Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) comprises approximately 5-15% of breast cancers and appears to have a distinct biology. It is less common than invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and few large studies have addressed its biologic characteristics and behaviour with respect to long-term clinical outcome and response to adjuvant therapy.Methods: This study is based on a large and well-characterised consecutive series of invasive breast carcinomas with a long-term follow-up (up to 25 years). This series included 415 (8%) patients with pure ILC and 2901 (55.7%) with IDC (not otherwise specified) identified from a consecutive cohort of 5680 breast tumours presented to our Breast Unit that were treated in a similar conventional manner. Clinicopathological, therapy and outcome information as well as data on a large panel of biomarkers were available.Results: Compared to IDC, patients with ILC tended to be older and present with tumours which are more frequently lower grade (typically, grade 2 [84%]), hormone-receptor positive (86% compared to 61% in IDC), of larger size, and with the absence of vascular invasion. A higher frequency of ILC was placed in the good Nottingham Prognostic Index group (40% compared to 21% in IDC). ILC showed indolent but progressive behavioural characteristics with nearly linear survival curves which crossed those of IDC after approximately 10 years of follow-up, thus eventually exhibiting a worse long-term outcome. Importantly, ILC showed a better response to adjuvant hormonal therapy (HT) with improvement in survival in patients who received HT compared with matched patients with IDC.Conclusion: ILC is a distinct entity of breast cancer that responds well to adjuvant HT. These data add important clinical information for assessing the long-term benefits of adjuvant HT use in ILC. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Histopathology (Oxford)		2008	JAN 2008	52	1	58-66	58	66							Lobular neoplasia of the breast represents a group of related malignancies with clinical implications ranging from risk lesions [atypical lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)] through to aggressive invasive lesions, notably invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma. The diversity in lobular carcinoma is evident at the morphological level, at the molecular marker level and in cytogenetic profiles. Research in these areas is already changing the face of the disease group, for example suggesting that some lobular and ductal carcinomas are closely related and even that one of the lobular group, the tubulo-lobular carcinomas, should, in fact, be regarded as a ductal cancer. More research is required to understand the long-term pathogenic implications of a diagnosis of in situ lobular neoplasia, particularly pleomorphic LCIS, and to understand the genetics behind the well-recognized high risk of bilateral disease. For invasive carcinoma, molecular studies will allow refinement of therapy and the possibility of novel targeted therapies, for example directed against fibroblast growth factor receptor 1.

(cili@fhcrc.org) ; Daling, Janet R.									Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention		2007	DEC 2007	16	12	2773-2780	2773	2780							Breast cancer incidence rates rose throughout the 1980s and 1990s in the United States but have recently declined through 2004. Studies reporting this decline primarily attribute it to the sharp decline in menopausal hormone use following publication of the Women's Health Initiative trial results. However, they have not stratified rates by either histologic type or race/ethnicity, which could further inform contributors to these trends. Using data from 13 cancer registries that participate in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, we evaluated annual percent changes (APC) in breast cancer incidence rates from 1995 to 2004 by histologic type and race/ethnicity for intervals identified using joinpoint regression. Invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma incidence rates fell steadily from 1998 to 2004 [APC, -3.07% (95% confidence interval, -4.10 to -2.02) and APC, -3.18% (95% confidence interval, -5.18 to -1.03), respectively]. Declines in rates of breast cancer overall and invasive ductal carcinoma were primarily limited to women >= 50 years of age and to non-Hispanic whites and Asian/ Pacific Islanders, and declines in rates of invasive lobular carcinoma were primarily limited to non-Hispanic whites. The majority of these declines began around 1998 and all began before 2002 when the Women's Health Initiative trial results were published; thus, the abrupt decline in hormone therapy use starting in 2002 is unlikely to be primarily responsible for the recent decline in breast cancer rates. The declines observed thus far are likely attributable to saturation of screening, although further declines related to the widespread cessation of hormone use may follow.														1055-9965		10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-0546

Here we report the identification of four novel modifier loci that influence different aspects of mammary tumor development in Apcml` ' mice. Analysis of tumor development in a backcross of (FVBB6 Apc(Min/+)) X B6 Apc(Min/+), mice has identified a modifier on chromosome 9 that significantly affects tumor multiplicity, and a modifier on chromosome 4 that significantly affects tumor latency and affects tumor number with suggestive significance. This modifier was also identified in a backcross involving 129X1/SvJ and B6 Apc(Min/+) mice. A modifier on chromosome IS specifically affects tumor latency but not tumor number. Kaplan-Meier analysis suggests there is at least an additive interaction affecting tumor latency between the loci on chromosomes 4 and 18. We also identified a modifier locus on chromosome 6 that interacts with the loci on chromosome 4 and chromosome 9 to affect tumor number. These results suggest that multiple genetic loci control different aspects of mammary tumor development. None of these modifiers is associated with intestinal tumor susceptibility, which indicates that these modifiers act on tumor development in a tissue-specific manner.														0008-5472		10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2487

LHSs allow the direct visualization of a large part of the breast glandular tree. Accordingly, LHSs have shown that in situ and invasive lobular carcinoma is a multilobar (and hence multifocal) neoplastic lesion in more than 50% of the cases, and that poorly differentiated duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS grade 3) is frequently unifocal., whereas it is often multifocal when the in situ lesion is a well-differentiated type (DCIS grade 1). Forty-five mastectomies were studied with large sections. Mastectomies were performed when quadrantectomy did not guarantee radical excision of the tumor with adequate cosmesis because of the large size of the lesion or because the neoplastic lesion was located below the nipple. Excluded were cases of lobular neoplasia or invasive lobular carcinoma, because they were reported separately, and cases of mastectomies performed for sarcoma or recurrent phyllodes tumor. All cases had undergone a preoperative diagnostic procedure (fine needle aspiration), and the relative positive material was reviewed. All 45 cases showed in situ duct carcinoma and 37 showed evidence of invasive duct carcinoma. Forty-two cases of DCIS were multifocal, whereas only 4 invasive duct carcinoma were shown as multifocal. When DCIS lesions were subdivided into 3 grades, no statistical significance was seen among the 3 groups of DCIS in regard to multifocality. Nevertheless, DCIS grade I was a widespread condition involving more than one lobe and quadrant, whereas DCIS grades 2 and 3 appeared more localized. DCIS grade I was more similar to that previously observed in lobular in situ neoplasia/lobular in situ carcinoma. In 66.6% of the cases, DCIS foci were found within the invasive areas, indicating a more than fortuitous occurrence (2-sided P = .0357). (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.

(scw9@gunet.georgetown.edu) ; Cocilovo, Costanza									Obstetrics & Gynecology		2007	DEC 2007	110	6	1404-1416	1404	1416							Accurately defining a patient's risk of developing breast cancer is a challenging endeavor. Many factors have been implicated in the causation of breast cancer and quantifying them is difficult. Risk stratification is performed using population models, such as the Gail model, as well as the patient's personal and family history and genetic testing. The clinician who is facile with these components will not only be able to identify those patients at highest risk for whom heightened surveillance is recommended, but also to allay the fears of the average-risk patient and provide them reassurance. Patients who are at very high risk of developing breast cancer are BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation carriers, those with a personal history of atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ with associated family history, those who have undergone therapeutic or similarly significant radiation exposure, and those with a history of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation in the family of an untested individual. Patients with an elevated risk, but not in the very high risk category, are those with a family history of breast cancer, personal history of breast cancer, significantly dense breast tissue, hormone replacement therapy longer than 10 years, and a history of atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ without family history of breast cancer. Risk-reducing strategies include chemoprevention with tamoxifen or raloxifene and surgical prophylaxis with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and/or bilateral salpingooophorectomy. A high-risk surveillance regimen includes annual mammography, annual magnetic resonance imaging in selected individuals, and semiannual clinical breast exams.														0029-7844		10.1097/01.AOG.0000295638.83285.97

Y.; King, Ann D.; Cheung, Humairah S.; Yang, Wei-Tse									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2007	SEP 2007	104	3	249-255	249	255							In vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( H-1-MRS) has been demonstrated to be successful in the differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions in a non-invasive manner by detecting increased levels of composite choline (Cho) compounds. Currently there is molecular evidence of increased Cho metabolism in breast cancer cells. In breast malignancies, 1H-MRS achieved a high- overall sensitivity (82%). Most test cases were infiltrating duct carcinoma, but infiltrating lobular, medullary, mucinous and adenoid cystic carcinomas were also positive by H-1-MRS. Large lesional size is a pre-requisite for H-1-MRS testing, and technical problems account for some of the false negative results. Another potential of H-1-MRS is to assess patients' response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In ductal carcinoma in situ, the results of H-1-MRS on the limited number of cases were negative. Most of the assessed benign breast lesions including fibroadenoma, fibrocystic changes, cysts and galactoceles, papilloma, tubular adenoma and phyllodes tumours and were mostly negative by H-1-MRS, with an overall false positive rate was about 8%. Normal breast tissue was almost always negative by H-1-MRS, whereas, lactating breast tissue showed positivity with a slightly different spectrum on further analysis. With the clinical use of stronger field MR scanners and better coils, the sensitivity of H-1-MRS may be further improved. With these improvements, H-1-MRS may potentially be useful in detection of smaller malignant lesions, characterization of malignant lesions into non-invasive or invasive, and as an invaluable tool in disease progression monitoring.

Overall biological and clinical features of ILC entail a more cautious diagnostic and therapeutic approach as compared with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). ILCs are more frequently multifocal, multicentric and/or bilateral. Mammography and ultrasound show, therefore, significant limitations, while the higher sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of multifocal and/or multicentric lesions seems to improve the accuracy of preoperative staging of ILCs. Early diagnosis is even more challenging because the difficult in the localization and the sparse cellularity of lobular tumours may determine a false negative core biopsy. ILC is characterized by low proliferative activity, C-ErbB-2 negativity, bcl-2 positivity, p53 and VEGF negativity, oestrogen and progesterone positive receptors, low grade and low likelihood of lymphatic-vascular invasion. However, this more favourable biological behaviour does not reflect into a better disease-free and overall survival as compared with I DC. Since lobular histology is associated with a higher risk of positive margins, mastectomy is often preferred to breast conservative surgery. Moreover, only few patients with ILC achieve a pathologic response to preoperative chemotherapy and, therefore, in most patients mastectomy can be regarded as the safer surgical treatment. The preoperative staging and the follow-up of patients with ILC are also complicated by the particular metastatic pattern of such histotype. In fact, metastases are more frequently distributed to the gastrointestinal tract, peritoneum/retroperitoneum and gynaecological organs than in IDC.

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2007	JUL 2007	104	1	109-114	109	114							Purpose Preoperative chemotherapy in patients with primary breast cancer treated with anthracyclines and taxanes results in high response rates, allowing breast conserving surgery (BCS) in patients primarily not suitable for this procedure. Pathological responses are important prognostic parameters for progression free and overall survival. We questioned the impact of histologic type invasive ductal carcinoma ( IDC) versus invasive lobular carcinoma ( ILC) on response to primary chemotherapy.Patients and Methods 161 patients with breast cancer received preoperative chemotherapy consisted of epidoxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) and docetaxel 75 mg/ m 2 administered in combination with granulocyte- colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF) on days 3 - 10 ( ED + G). Pathological complete response ( pCR), biological markers and type of surgery as well as progression free and overall survival were compared between IDC and ILC.Results Out of 161 patients, 124 patients presented with IDC and 37 with ILC. Patients with ILC were less likely to have a pCR ( 3% vs. 20%, P < 0.009) and breast conserving surgeries ( 51% vs. 79%, P < 0.001). Patients with ILC tended to have oestrogen receptor positive tumors ( 86% vs. 52%, P < 0.0001), HER 2 negative tumors ( 69% vs. 84%), and lower nuclear grade ( nuclear grade 3, 16% vs. 46%, P < 0.001). Patients with ILC tended to have longer time to progression ( TTP) ( 42 months vs. 26 months) and overall survival ( 69 months vs. 65 months).Conclusions Our results indicate that patients with ILC achieved a lower pCR rate and ineligibility for BCS to preoperative chemotherapy, but this did not result in a survival disadvantage. Because of these results new strategies to achieve a pCR are warranted.				Gnant, Michael/0000-0003-1002-2118										0167-6806		10.1007/s10549-006-9397-3

British Journal of Cancer		2007	MAY 7 2007	96	9	1404-1408	1404	1408							Reduction/loss of E-cadherin is associated with the development and progression of many epithelial tumours. Dysadherin, recently characterised by members of our research team, has an anti-cell-cell adhesion function and downregulates E-cadherin in a posttranscriptional manner. The aim of the present study was to study the role of dysadherin in breast cancer progression, in association with the E-cadherin expression and the histological type. We have selected ductal carcinoma, which is by far the most common type and lobular carcinoma, which has a distinctive microscopic appearance. Dysadherin and E-cadherin expression was examined immunohistochemically in 70 invasive ductal carcinomas, no special type (NST), and 30 invasive lobular carcinomas, with their adjacent in situ components. In ductal as well as in lobular carcinoma dysadherin was expressed only in the invasive and not in the in situ component, and this expression was independent of the E- cadherin expression. Specifically, all 10 (100%) Grade 1, 37out of 45(82.2%) Grade 2 and six out of 15 (40%) Grade 3 invasive ductal carcinomas showed preserved E- cadherin expression, while 'positive dysadherin expression' was found in six out of 10 (60%) Grade 1, 34 out of 45(75.5%) Grade 2 and all 15 (100%) Grade 3 neoplasms. None of the 30 infiltrating lobular carcinomas showed preserved E- cadherin expression, while all the 30 infiltrating lobular carcinomas exhibited 'positive dysadherin expression'. Dysadherin may play an important role in breast cancer progression by promoting invasion and, particularly in lobular carcinomas, it might also be used as a marker of invasion.

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2007	MAY 2007	103	1	1-10	1	10							Magnetic resonance imaging of the breast is useful in assessing breast lesions. An understanding of the pathologic characteristics of the tumors may help to understand these magnetic resonance imaging observations. Large lesional size (> 10 mm), ill-defined margin, and irregular outlines are associated with malignancy. These correlate with the pathological features of breast tumor, characterized by rapid growth rate, large size, and infiltrative growth pattern, invasion into stroma resulting in desmoplasia, and hence irregular outline and margin. The detection and estimation of tumor extent of invasive lobular carcinoma is problematic, even with magnetic resonance imaging, which is considered the most sensitivity. This inaccuracy likely derives from the characteristic linear, single cells infiltration growth pattern of the tumor, which is also often underestimated by clinical examination. Estimation of tumor extent after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also essential but problematic by imaging, as the shrunken tumor becomes fibrotic, with stromal hyalinization, diminished microvasculature and tumor break up causing size underestimation. Non-enhancement of breast tumors occurs in about 8% of cases correlates with diffuse growth pattern, particularly of infiltrative lobular carcinoma. The observation of disproportionately high non-enhancing ductal carcinoma in situ remains an enigma. Finally, early rim enhancement correlates with small cancer nests, low ratio of peripheral to central fibrosis and high ratio of peripheral to central microvessel density. These may be related to increased vascular endothelial growth factor mediated increased microvessel density as well as increased permeability, which manifest as increased rapid contrast uptake and dissipation.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-006-9352-3																		
J	BCI:BCI200700335507				Estrogen receptor expression of DMBA-induced mammary tumors in intact and ovariectomized lean and obese Zucker rats.		Hakkak, Reza; Shaaf, Saeid; MacLeod, Stewart; Talley, Lori									FASEB Journal		2007	APR 2007	21	5	A734	A734								Obesity is associated with increased risk for postmenopausal breast cancer. Clinical data suggest that women with Estrogen Receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer have poorer outcome than those with ER+ tumors. The main objective of this study was to investigate whether obesity can be associated with the expression of ER in mammary tumors in the presence or absence of ovarian estrogen. Lean and obese Zucker rats were sham operated or ovariectomized at age 40 days and were gavaged at age 50 days with 65 mg/kg DMBA. Rats were weighed and palpated twice weekly for detection of mammary tumors and killed 135 days post-DMBA treatment. ER immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tumors. The incidence of mammary tumors was 59% in the obese, sham-operated (O/S) rats compared to 30% in the lean sham-operated (L/S) group (P < 0.05) and 36% for the obese ovariectomized (0/0) rats while no lean ovariectomized (L/O) rats developed tumors (P < 0.001). ER expression was evaluated for all the ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma (IDC) tumors and the results are as follows; L/S group (17% ER - and 83% ER+), O/S group (45% ER- and 55% ER+) and O/O groups had 50% ER- and 50% ER +. These preliminary results suggest that obesity may increase the incidence of ER negative tumors in the obese Zucker rat DMBA mammary tumor model.														0892-6638

(mkennedy@mater.ie)									Histopathology (Oxford)		2007	APR 2007	50	5	607-614	607	614							Aims Radial scars (RS) are benign entities, frequently identified on screening mammography, which may be associated with malignancy. Much debate has been generated with regard to the optimum management of RS. We present our experience of RS in the first 5 years of a screening programme. The aim was to evaluate (i) the incidence of atypia and malignancy and (ii) the value of the preoperative core biopsy. We also further characterize the histological features.Methods and results One hundred and twenty-five histologically confirmed cases of RS were reviewed (111 had preoperative biopsies). Thirty-one (24.8%) patients had a final malignant diagnosis (11 with invasive malignancy) and 28 (22.4%) showed atypia (including lobular carcinoma in situ). In those with core biopsies and a final malignant diagnosis, 12 cases were categorized as B5 (41.3%), three as B4 (10.3%), 12 as B3 (41.3%) and two as B2 (7%). Common histological features included obliterated ducts and chronic inflammation with, less frequently, neural hyperplasia (16.8%) and perineural invasion (3.2%).Conclusions The high incidence of atypia and malignancy identified in our study justifies our policy of removing all mammographically detected RS. We emphasize the utility of preoperative core biopsy evaluation in permitting one-stage surgical therapy in those with B5 diagnoses.

A large foamy or granular cytoplasm of histiocytoid carcinoma was characterized by abundant mucin, but the properties of mucin in histiocytoid carcinoma have also not been well investigated. We selected eight cases of histiocytoid features of invasive lobular carcinoma (HLC) and compared with 14 age- and tumor size-matched cases of classical invasive lobular carcinoma (CLC). Mucin profiles were significantly different between the two groups: a fair number of HLC cases were immunopositive for MUC2 and MUC5AC (75 and 50%, respectively); in contrast, almost all CLC cases showed both as negative. Both groups were immunopositive for MUC1 and negative for MUC4 and MUC6. The prognosis of HLC was significantly worse than CLC; HLC showed shorter disease-free time than CLC (p=0.0262). In particular, HLC with MUC2 and MUC5AC expressions showed significantly shorter disease-free time and survival time than lobular carcinoma without the expressions of MUC2 and MUC5AC (p=0.0055 and p=0.0060, respectively). Therefore, the expression of Cynon-mammary mucins', such as MUC2 and MUC5AC in HLC, is characteristic and indicates the more malignant transformation of tumor cells and poorer prognosis.

(ian.ellis@nottingham.ac.uk)									American Journal of Surgical Pathology		2007	MAR 2007	31	3	417-426	417	426							This study was undertaken to determine the morphologic features and frequency of putative precursor lesions involved in the development of some pure forms of special types and low grade breast carcinoma. We reviewed 147 successive tumor cases, comprising tubular carcinoma (TC); pure type (n = 56) and mixed type (n = 20), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC); classic type (n = 57), and tubutolobular carcinoma (TLC; n = 14). The presence of preinvasive lesions including columnar cell lesions (CCLs), usual epithelial hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and lobular neoplasia (LN) was determined. Estrogen receptor and E-cadherin immunohistochemistry was performed. Ninety-five percent (95%) of pure TCs had associated CCLs with the majority showing flat epithelial atypia. Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)/DCIS was present in 89% patients. Colocalization of CCL, ADH/DCIS, and TC was seen in 85% patients, all displaying the same cytologic-nuclear morphology in most cases. LN was seen in 16%. In ILC, 91% cases showed LN. CCL and ADH/DCIS were seen in 60% and 42% cases, respectively. E-cadherin was positive in TLC but reduced in TC and completely absent in ILC. In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that CCLs are associated with pure and mixed forms of TC, and that LN is involved in ILC development. Our observations suggest that these lesions represent family members of low grade precursor, in situ and invasive neoplastic lesions of the breast. Molecular studies are being performed to substantiate the hypothesis that tubular and lobular carcinomas have direct evolutionary links to CCLs and flat epithelial atypia.

J	BCI:BCI200700162184	17095049			Significance of flat epithelial atypia on mammotome core needle biopsy: should it be excised?		Kunju, Lakshmi P.; Kleer, Celina G. (kleer@med.umich.edu)									Human Pathology		2007	JAN 2007	38	1	35-41	35	41							The aim of this study was to determine the morphologic types, associations, and significance of flat epithelial atypia (FEA) with or without atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) in mammotome core needle biopsies. We evaluated the correlation of FEA in core biopsies with follow-up excision biopsies to predict the likelihood of upgrade to carcinoma. We also investigated the utility of Ki-67 in predicting which lesions were associated with carcinoma in the excisional biopsies. Core biopsies with a diagnosis of atypia were categorized as pure FEA, Pure ADH, or both. The following parameters were recorded: indication for core biopsies, presence of rnicrocalcifications, inflammation, and stromal changes. A total of 60 core biopsies from 56 patients were studied. Pure ADH, pure FEA, and concomitant FEA and ADH were seen in 13%, 23%, and 64% of core biopsies, respectively. The most common architectural pattern of FEA resembled blunt duct adenosis (52%), followed by cystically dilated ducts with secretions (38%) and apocrinc features (10%). Chronic inflammation and stromal changes were noted in 29% and 36% of FEA, respectively. Excisional biopsies in 48 of 56 patients demonstrated ductal carcinoma in situ and/or invasive carcinoma in 10 patients (21%), lobular carcinoma in situ or atypical lobular hyperplasia in 5 (11%), residual ADH in 11 (23%), and no atypia in 24 patients (50%). Three (21%) of 14 pure FEA upgraded to ductal carcinoma in situ and/or invasive carcinoma on excisional biopsy. The staining for Ki-67 in FEA/ADH was similar regardless of whether they were upgraded to carcinoma or not. In summary, we found a strong association between FEA and ADH, which may reflect a biologic progression. Most FEAs have a low-power appearance of a well-circumscribed group of ducts. Chronic inflammation and stromal changes are present in a subset of cases. Flat epithelial atypia shows a risk of upgrade to carcinoma similar to that of ADH and, hence, should be recognized and warrants a follow-up excision. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

(barthp@med.uni-marburg.de)									Pathology Research and Practice		2007		203	9	695-698	695	698							It is generally agreed that invasive carcinomas of the breast consistently lack stromal CD34(+) fibrocytes. The 14 pertinent literature shows that this assumption is well based for invasive ductal carcinomas, but evidence of loss of stromal CD34(+) cells in lobular carcinomas is weak. We present a series of 22 invasive lobular carcinomas (ILCs) which, in contrast to invasive ductal carcinomas, display a gradual reduction of stromal CD34(+) fibrocytes. One third of the study population showed a completely preserved population of CD34(+) fibrocytes, in another third, this cell population was reduced in comparison to normal breast tissue, and in the remaining third, loss of CD34(+) fibrocytes comparable to that occurring in virtually all invasive ductal carcinomas was found. The present study shows that loss of CD34(+) fibrocytes is not a consistent feature of invasive carcinomas of the breast. Therefore, a preserved CD34(+) stromal cell population does not exclude malignancy, and analysis of the stromal CD34 expression should be handled with care when used as a diagnostic tool.

In this issue of Cancer Cell, Derksen et al. describe a new mouse model that mimics multiple features of invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast (ILC), a histological subtype of human breast cancer for which no mouse model currently exists. This model further reveals an important causal link between E-cadherin loss and tumor initiation and metastasis and, in doing so, provides a valuable entree into the tumor-suppressive functions of E-cadherin as well as the molecular underpinnings of ILC.														1535-6108		10.1016/j.ccr.2006.10.016

In a study designed to identify genes up-regulated in breast cancer, a cDNA clone corresponding to a novel gene C35 (C17orf37) was selected by representational difference analysis of tumor and normal human mammary cell lines. Abundant expression of C35 transcript in tumors was confirmed by Northern blot and real-time PCR. The C35 gene is located on chromosome 17q12, 505 nucleotides from the 3' end of the ERBB2 oncogene, the antigenic target for trastuzumab (Herceptin (TM)) therapy. The chromosomal arrangement of the genes encoding C35 and ERBB2 is tail to tail. An open reading frame encodes a 12-kDa protein of unknown function. Immunohistochemical analysis detected robust and frequent expression of C35 protein, including 32% of grade 1 and 66% of grades 2 and 3 infiltrating ductal carcinomas of the breast (in contrast to 20% overexpressing HER-2/neu), 38% of infiltrating lobular carcinoma (typically HER-2/neu negative), as well as tumors arising in other tissues. C35 was not detected in 38 different normal human tissues, except Leydig cells in the testes and trace levels in a small percentage of normal breast tissue samples. The distinct and favorable expression profile of C35 spanning early through late stages of disease, including high frequency of overexpression in various breast carcinoma, abundant expression in distant metastases, and either absence or low level expression in normal human tissues, warrants further investigation of the relevance of C35 as a biomarker and/or a target for development of broadly applicable cancer-specific therapies.														1535-7163		10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0389

Methods 160 pre-menopausal breast cancer patients were collected, 62/159 (39. 0%) of them were node positive, 91/158 (57. 6%) were ER positive, and 95/155 (61.3%) were PR positive. 111 cases had infiltrative ductal carcinoma, 26 cases had infiltrative lobular carcinoma, and 22 cases with others. In 152 cases data were collected by face-to-face interview and 8 cases by phone conversation. Types and cycles of chemotherapy regimen as well as menstrual abnormalities were recorded before, during, and after chemotherapy completion. Follow up duration was 12 - 72 months after chemotherapy completion for all patients. Results 107 (66. 9%) developed CIA, 24 cases returned to normal menses (22.4%), 83 cases continued CIA during more than 12-month follow up 77. 6%). The rate of CIA increased with age ( P < 0.01). During the follow up, disease free survival DFS) rate was 85. 9% in CIA group and 79. 2% in non-CIA group, with no statistically significant difference. But in hormonal receptor positive patients, DFS was 80.0% in non-CIA and 90.1% in CIA, respectively ( P = 0. 04), showing a significant difference. Because of the small number of died cases, no analysis of the overall outcome was carried out. Conclusion Adjuvant chemotherapy causes ovarian function suppression, and may further leading to amenorrhoea. Women who experienced amenorrhoea after chemotherapy had a significantly better disease-free survival ( DFS) rate showed by univariate analysis than women who continued normal menstruation. Chemotherapy is insufficient therapy for very young patients who are in high risk with hormone responsive disease, particularly when chemotherapy fails to induce amenorrhea. Further research is needed to evaluate interventional chemotherapy to improve the quality of life in women with early stage breast cancer who experienced ovarian toxicity. The post -chemotherapy menstruation status is a clinically valuable, objective and salient marker for sufficient endocrine effect of cbemotherapy in ER/PR-positive premenopausal patients.														0253-3766																				
J	BCI:BCI200600643260	16702952			A comprehensive study of chromosome 16q in invasive ductal and lobular breast carcinoma using array CGH		Roylance, R. (rebecca.roylance@cancer.org.uk) ; Gorman, P.; Papior, T.; Wan, Y-L; Ives, M.; Watson, J. E.; Collins, C.; Wortham, N.; Langford, C.; Fiegler, H.; Carter, N.; Gillett, C.; Sasieni, P.; Pinder, S.; Hanby, A.; Tomlinson, I.									Oncogene		2006	OCT 19 2006	25	49	6544-6553	6544	6553							We analysed chromosome 16q in 106 breast cancers using tiling-path array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). About 80% of ductal cancers (IDCs) and all lobular cancers (ILCs) lost at least part of 16q. Grade I (GI) IDCs and ILCs often lost the whole chromosome arm. Grade II (GII) and grade III ( GIII) IDCs showed less frequent whole-arm loss, but often had complex changes, typically small regions of gain together with larger regions of loss. The boundaries of gains/losses tended to cluster, common sites being 54.5-55.5 Mb and 57.4-58.8 Mb. Overall, the peak frequency of loss (83% cancers) occurred at 61.9-62.9 Mb. We also found several 'minimal' regions of loss/gain. However, no mutations in candidate genes (TRADD, CDH5, CDH8 and CDH11) were detected. Cluster analysis based on copy number changes identified a large group of cancers that had lost most of 16q, and two smaller groups ( one with few changes, one with a tendency to show copy number gain). Although all morphological types occurred in each cluster group, IDCs ( especially GII/GIII) were relatively over-represented in the smaller groups. Cluster groups were not independently associated with survival. Use of tiling-path aCGH prompted re-evaluation of the hypothetical pathways of breast carcinogenesis. ILCs have the simplest changes on 16q and probably diverge from the IDC lineage close to the stage of 16q loss. Higher-grade IDCs probably develop from low-grade lesions in most cases, but there remains evidence that some GII/GIII IDCs arise without a GI precursor.				/0000-0003-4167-8910; Sasieni, Peter/0000-0003-1509-8744										0950-9232		10.1038/sj.onc.1209659

(lkestin@beaumont.edu) ; Goldstein, Neal S.; Vicini, Frank A.									International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics		2006	OCT 1 2006	66	2	365-371	365	371							Purpose: The significance of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) associated with invasive breast cancer in patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT) remains controversial. We examined the impact of the presence and extent of LCIS associated with invasive breast cancer on clinical outcome in BCT patients.Methods and Materials: From 1980 to 1996, 607 cases of invasive breast cancer were treated with BCT. All slides were reviewed by a single pathologist. Positive margin was defined as presence of invasive carcinoma/ductal carcinoma in situ at the inked margin. Multiple clinical, pathologic, and treatment-related variables were analyzed for their association with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and true recurrence/marginal miss (TR/MM). Median follow-up was 8.7 years.Results: Fifty-six patients (9%) had LCIS in association with invasive cancer. On univariate analysis, positive final margin, positive/no reexcision, smaller maximum specimen dimension, and the presence of LCIS predicted for IBTR. The 10-year IBTR rate was 14% for cases with LCIS vs. 7% without LCIS (p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, positive margin (p < 0.01), positive/no reexcision (p = 0.04), and presence of LCIS (p = 0.02) remained independently associated with IBTR; positive margin (p < 0.01) and LCIS (p = 0.04) were also associated with TR/MM failure. When examining only cases with negative final margins, the presence of LCIS remained associated with higher IBTR and TR/MM rates (p < 0.01).Conclusion: The presence of LCIS was independently associated with higher rate of IBTR and TR/MM after BCT for invasive breast cancer. LCIS may have significant premalignant potential and progress to an invasive IBTR at the site of index lesion. The adequacy of excision of LCIS associated with invasive carcinoma should be considered in patients undergoing BCT.

A total of 120 and 1902 women with bilateral and unilateral breast cancers were enrolled; various factors, including those concerning their medical history and life style, were extracted. Using Kaplan-Meier method, we calculate the cumulative incidence of contralateral breast cancer. The results show as follows. The cumulative incidences of contralateral breast cancer at 1, 3, 5 years after diagnosis of first breast cancer were 1.15, 1.94, and 2.97%, respectively. The statistically significant risk factors included menopause (Hazard Ratio (HR) =1.56, (1.00-2.42)), invasive lobular carcinoma (HR=2.98, (1.35-6.56)), receiving chemotherapy (HR=2.21, (1.43-3.42)) and/or radiotherapy (HR=3.32, (2.19-5.05) and a protective factor was tamoxifen therapy (HR=0.5 (0.34-0.74). Size of the second occurred tumour (2.97 cm) tended to be smaller than the first one (3.58 cm) with borderline statistical significance (p=0.0731). Comparing to the existing data on Western countries, we find a higher risk for developing contralateral breast cancer in Taiwan where a low incidence of first breast cancer rate with early age diagnosis is noted. It suggests that first primary breast tumour with early age of onset and lobular carcinoma are found more likely to develop bilateral breast cancers.

American Journal of Clinical Pathology		2006	AUG 2006	126	2	310-313	310	313							To address the significance of lobular neoplasia (LN) in breast core needle biopsy specimens, we prospectively obtained LN cases and correlated results of subsequent tissue sampling. LN was diagnosed by core needle biopsy in 467 women; in 101 (21.6%), invasive carcinoma (IC) or ductal carcinoma in situ (DUS) was diagnosed concurrently. Two patients (0.4%) had previous diagnoses of IC or DUS, and 17 (3.6%) had a concurrent diagnosis of contralateral IC or DUS. Of 366 patients without a concurrent diagnosis of IC or DUS, subsequent tissue diagnoses were available for 156 cases (42.6%). Of 60 cases of LN and atypical ductal hyperplasia on the biopsy, 5 had IC and 10 had DUS on the excision (total, 25%). Of 4 women with LN and a mucocele-like lesion on the biopsy, none had IC or DUS on excision. Of 92 with LN alone on the biopsy, 7 had IC (6) or DCIS (1) on excision. Two cases were in sites away from the biopsy site, 3 in subsequent excisions of the biopsy site, and 2 after previous excision of the biopsy site without finding IC or DCIS. Although LN is associated with a high overall rate of IC and DUS (30%), excision of the biopsy site for women with LN alone on core needle biopsy has a very low rate of IC and DUS in our center Women in whom biopsy sites are excised are still at risk for subsequent DUS and IC.														0002-9173		10.1309/GT453DBMLRNPNKL2

(amf5@le.ac.uk)									Cancer Letters		2006	JUN 18 2006	237	2	155-166	155	166							Aneuploidy and chromosome instability are two of the most common abnormalities in cancer cells. They arise through defects in cell division and, specifically, in the unequal segregation of chromosomes between daughter cells during mitosis. A number of cell cycle dependent protein kinases have been identified that control mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. Some of these localize to the centrosome and regulate mitotic spindle formation. One such protein is Nek2, a member of the NIMA-related serine/threonine kinase family. Data are emerging that Nek2 is abnormally expressed in a wide variety of human cancers. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the expression, regulation and function of Nek2, consider how Nek2 may contribute to chromosome instability, and ask whether it might make an attractive target for chemotherapeutic intervention in human cancer.

The purpose of this study was to compare the conversion rate from BCT to mastectomy among patients with lobular (ILC) and ductal carcinoma (IDC), and to compare the number of resections needed to obtain negative margins.METHODS. In all, 349 patients with pure or mixed ILC were identified from a database and 318 were successfully matched to 2 controls with IDC on the basis of year of diagnosis, menopausal status, and stage of disease. Conditional logistic regression was used to control for matching.RESULTS. Patients with ILC were older, had larger tumors (2.6 vs. 2.1 cm; P <.001), and were more likely to have contraindications to BCT (25% vs. 20%). In patients thought to be candidates for BCT, no difference in success rate was noted on the basis of histologic type after controlling for age and stage. In those undergoing BCT, no difference in the number of procedures was seen on the bases of histology after adjustment for age and stage.CONCLUSIONS. Patients with ILC are not more likely to fail BCT than those with IDC, nor do they require more operations to obtain negative margins. These results do not support the use of more extensive preoperative evaluation such as magnetic resonance imaging in patients with ILC.														0008-543X		10.1002/cncr.21921																		
J	BCI:BCI200600388296	16785781			LKB1 protein expression in human breast cancer		Fenton, Hubert; Carlile, Brian; Montgomery, Elizabeth A.; Carraway, Hetty; Herman, James; Sahin, Fikret; Su, Gloria H.; Argani, Pedram (pargani@jhmi.edu)									Applied Immunohistochemistry & Molecular Morphology		2006	JUN 2006	14	2	146-153	146	153							Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the LKB1/STK11 gene. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is associated with an increased risk of developing intestinal and extraintestinal cancers, including pancreatic, lung, and breast carcinomas. LKB1 gene inactivation has recently been demonstrated in a subset of sporadic pancreatic and lung carcinomas. The role of the LKB1 gene in sporadic breast carcinomas remains unclear, though recent studies suggest inactivation only within papillary carcinomas. Using a commercially available polyclonal antibody that has been shown to mirror LKB1 genetic status in gastrointestinal and pulmonary carcinomas, the authors performed IHC on a large series of breast cancers using tissue microarrays (TMAs). All abnormal TMA results were confirmed using whole sections; specifically, whole sections from the donor blocks of lesions demonstrating diminished or absent LKB1 protein expression on TMA were evaluated to compare labeling of the lesion with that of the surrounding normal breast. In all cases, normal breast epithelium demonstrated strong cytoplasmic labeling (providing an internal positive control), whereas the stroma was nonreactive. Luminal cells typically labeled more strongly than myoepithelial cells. Among 70 invasive ductal carcinomas, 3 (4.3%) showed complete loss of LKB1 labeling, whereas 6 others (8.6%) showed diminished labeling. Of the eight intraductal carcinoma lesions adjacent to these invasive carcinomas, one (12.5%) showed complete loss of LKB1 labeling and one other (12.5%) showed diminished labeling; these results were identical to those of the adjacent invasive carcinomas. One of 10 (10%) hematogenous metastases of mammary carcinoma showed loss of LKB1 labeling. Nine of the 10 invasive carcinomas and both of the ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cases showing loss of or diminished LKB 1 expression were of high grade. In contrast, all 13 pure nonpapillary DCIS lesions, all 5 invasive lobular carcinomas and 3 accompanying lobular carcinoma in situ lesions, all 7 papillary DCIS lesions, and all 3 papillomas evaluated showed intact LKB1 labeling. Therefore, although frequent methylation of the LKBI gene has been reported in papillary carcinomas of the breast, the authors did not find loss of protein expression in these lesions. Instead, it was found that loss of LKB1 protein expression occurs in a subset of high-grade in situ and invasive mammary carcinomas. The authors found LKB1 gene methylation in several of these invasive carcinomas. Given recent Western blot results indicating that diminished LKB1 expression in breast carcinomas correlates with shorter relapse-free survival, LKB1 IHC merits evaluation as a potential prognostic marker for breast carcinoma.														1062-3345		10.1097/01.pai.0000176157.07908.20																		
J	BCI:BCI200600451750	16631754			Molecular pathology of breast apocrine carcinomas: A protein expression signature specific for benign apocrine metaplasia		Celis, Julio E. (jec@cancer.dk) ; Gromova, Irina; Gromov, Pavel; Moreira, Jose M. A.; Cabezon, Teresa; Friis, Esbern; Rank, Fritz									FEBS Letters		2006	MAY 22 2006	580	12, Sp. Iss. SI	2935-2944	2935	2944							Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that encompasses a wide range of histopathological types including: invasive ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, tubular carcinoma, and apocrine carcinoma among others. Pure apocrine carcinomas represent about 0.5% of all invasive breast cancers according to the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group Registry, and despite the fact that they are morphologically distinct from other breast lesions, there are at present no standard molecular criteria available for their diagnosis. In addition, the relationship between benign apocrine changes and breast carcinoma is unclear and has been a matter of discussion for many years. Recent proteome expression profiling studies of breast apocrine macrocysts, normal breast tissue, and breast tumours have identified specific apocrine biomarkers [15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase)] present in early and advanced apocrine lesions. These biomarkers in combination with proteins found to be characteristically upregulated in pure apocrine carcinomas (psoriasin, S100A9, and p53) provide a protein expression signature distinctive for benign apocrine metaplasias and apocrine cystic lesions. These studies have also presented compelling evidence for a direct link, through the expression of the prostaglandin degrading enzyme 15-PGDH, between early apocrine lesions and pure apocrine carcinomas. Moreover, specific antibodies against the components of the expression signature have identified precursor lesions in the linear histological progression to apocrine carcinoma. Finally, the identification of proteins that characterize the early stages of mammary apocrine differentiation such as 15-PGDH, HMG-CoA reductase, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) has opened a window of opportunity for pharmacological intervention, not only in a therapeutic manner but also in a chemopreventive setting.

M.; Cordoba Iturriagagoitia, A.									Journal of Clinical Pathology (London)		2006	MAY 2006	59	5	518-522	518	522							Background: Cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (IHC) reveals a higher rate of occult lymph node metastases among lobular carcinomas than among ductal breast cancers. IHC is widely used but is seldom recommended for the evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients.Objective: To assess the value of cytokeratin IHC for the detection of metastases in sentinel lymph nodes of patients with invasive lobular carcinoma.Methods: The value of IHC, the types of metastasis found by this method, and the involvement of nonsentinel lymph nodes were analysed in a multi-institutional cohort of 449 patients with lobular breast carcinoma, staged by sentinel lymph node biopsy and routine assessment of the sentinel lymph nodes by IHC when multilevel haematoxylin and eosin staining revealed no metastasis.Results: 189 patients (42%) had some type of sentinel node involvement, the frequency of this increasing with increasing tumour size. IHC was needed for identification of 65 of these cases: 17 of 19 isolated tumour cells, 40 of 64 micrometastases, and 8 of 106 larger metastases were detected by this means. Non-sentinel-node involvement was noted in 66 of 161 cases undergoing axillary dissection. Although isolated tumour cells were not associated with further lymph node involvement, sentinel node positivity detected by IHC was associated with further nodal metastases in 12 of 50 cases (0.24), a proportion that is higher than previously reported for breast cancer in general.Conclusions: IHC is recommended for the evaluation of sentinel nodes from patients with lobular breast carcinoma, as the micrometastases or larger metastases demonstrated by this method are often associated with a further metastatic nodal load.

J	BCI:BCI200600310317	16525635			PLC-beta 2 is highly expressed in breast cancer and is associated with a poor outcome: A study on tissue microarrays		Bertagnolo, Valeria; Benedusi, Mascia; Querzoli, Patrizia; Pedriali, Massimo; Magri, Eros; Brugnoli, Federica; Capitani, Silvano (cps@dns.unife.it)									International Journal of Oncology		2006	APR 2006	28	4	863-872	863	872							Despite the identification of many putative biomarkers in breast cancer, a specific pattern of proteins to be used as a prognosticator is not well defined. A growing body of evidence supports the role of phospholipase C (PLC) in the invasion and metastasis of different tumors, including breast cancer. To assess whether the expression of specific PLC isoforms correlates with malignancy-related features of human breast tumors and, hence, could have prognostic significance, an immunohistochemical analysis of PLC-beta 2 was performed on tissue microarrays and the relationship between PLC-beta 2 expression and biological and clinicopathological factors was assessed. The analysis of 77 samples of breast tumors with different histotypes revealed that PLC-beta 2 is highly expressed in a large majority of the analyzed cancer tissue, particularly ductal and lobular carcinomas, in comparison with normal breast. The expression of PLC-beta 2 in primary tumors correlated with size, proliferation index and final grade, while no significant relationship was observed with nodal status or estrogen receptor levels, or with the expression of tumor suppressor p53. Remarkably, high PLC-beta 2 levels in primary tumors predict an unfavourable prognosis, suggesting the contribution of this protein to the progression of human mammary carcinomas. Our data indicate that PLC-beta 2 expression correlates highly with breast cancer malignancy and suggest that it can be included, as an independent marker, among the prognostic indicators in current use.

A plausible explanation is that such in situ (DCIS) & invasive ductal carcinoma (InvDC) is not a separate neoplastic process but is genetically related to LCIS. If true, we expect coexistent lobular & ductal carcinoma to have highly concordant genomic profiles. To test this hypothesis, we compared DNA abnormalities, as defined by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), in concurrent LCIS, DCIS &, in some cases, InvDC.Design: We used a 6,912 BAC clone microarray to identify & map gains & losses in DNA from cells microdissected from paraffin embedded tissues (PETs). Using our new aCGH pre-processing software, specifically adapted to PETs, we calculated the number of concordant clone specific changes in each component of synchronous LCIS & DCIS (N=4) & LCIS, DCIS & InvDC (N=3).Results: There were many concordant clone specific gains & losses in coexistent LCIS, DCIS & InvDC in each patient; similarity was much higher between different components within a patient than between patients.Conclusion: Despite the clearly different morphologic appearances that have conventionally defined them, LCIS, DCIS & InvDC occurring in the same breast are not independent events but arise from a common abnormal progenitor.

J	BCI:BCI200600285734	16402338			Comparative expressed sequence hybridization reveals differential gene expression in morphological breast cancer subtypes		Vanden Bempt, Isabelle (isabelle.vandenbempt@uz.kuleuven.ac.be) ; Vanhentenrijk, Vera; Drijkoningen, Maha; De Wolf-Peeters, Christiane									Journal of Pathology		2006	MAR 2006	208	4	486-494	486	494							In this study, comparative expressed sequence hybridization (CESH) has been used to compare gene expression patterns in three morphologically different breast cancer subtypes: classic-type invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), poorly differentiated ERBB2-negative invasive ductal carcinoma-not otherwise specified (IDC-NOS), and poorly differentiated ERBB2-positive IDC-NOS. CESH allows global detection of chromosomal regions with differential gene expression in a way similar to that of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Eight cases of each breast cancer subtype were included in the study. For each subtype, two pools of four cases each were constructed. CESH was used to compare both pools within the same morphological subtype, followed by a comparison of pools belonging to different subtypes. This revealed three chromosomal regions that were differentially expressed in ductal and lobular carcinomas, including relative overexpression at 8q13-q23 and 16q22, and relative underexpression at 8p21-p22. In addition, an expression signature characterized by relative overexpression at 3q24-q26.3, 14q23-31, 17q12, and 20q12-13 was identified for ERBB2-positive IDC-NOS. In summary, CESH analysis highlights chromosomal regions of differential gene expression that are associated with morphologically defined breast cancer subtypes and suggests that regions on chromosome 8 are of interest in the discrimination between ductal and lobular carcinomas. In addition, using CESH, it was possible to identify an ERBB2 expression signature, comprising four chromosomal regions with potential significance in the aggressive behaviour of ERBB2-positive IDC-NOS.

J	BCI:BCI200600297885	16328349			The impact of large sections and 3D technique on the study of lobular in situ and invasive carcinoma of the breast		Foschini, Maria P.; Righi, Alberto; Cucchi, Maria C.; Ragazzini, Teresa; Merelli, Stefano; Santeramo, Bruna; Eusebi, Vincenzo (Vincenzo.Eusebi@ausl.bologna.it)									Virchows Archiv		2006	MAR 2006	448	3	256-261	256	261							The aim of the present study was to investigate the type of intraglandular spread of lobular neoplasia (LN) and its relationship with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) through three-dimensional (3D) stereomicroscopy and analyses of large histological sections (histological macrosections, HM). Fifteen cases showing multiple foci of in situ LN and/or ILC (1 pure LN, 12 LN+ILC, and 2 pure ILC) constituted the basis of the present study. Thirteen cases were treated with mastectomy (including the case of pure LN), and two cases were treated with quadrantectomy. In all cases, large parallel 5-mm-thick sections were embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Selected large paraffin blocks were investigated with stereomicroscopy. The H&E-stained HM were then compared with the corresponding tissues examined using stereomicroscopy. (1) LN was multicentric in nine cases. (2) The average maximum distance among LN foci was 37.9 mm, while the average maximum distance among ILC areas was 58.2 mm. (3) On 3D examination, LN-filled acini and ducts appeared dilated. When "Pagetoid spread" was present, the ducts were lined by a continuous layer of neoplastic epithelium. (4) No anastomoses between lobes were observed in the two cases where glandular trees were visualized. (5) In 12 cases, ILC areas enveloped ducts and acini affected by LN-an association that was more than coincidental. (6) Multicentric ILC areas not associated with LN indicated vascular spread. It is concluded that the information given in LN and ILC, obtained by analyses of large histological sections, is far superior than that obtained by analyses of conventional histological sections, which underestimate multiple distant small foci of invasion. 3D sections are useful in understanding the architecture of specific lesions.

This paper reports the results of a systematic analysis of PIK3CA mutations in different histological types of breast carcinoma. One hundred and eighty invasive breast carcinomas, comprising 74 ductal, 56 lobular, 22 mucinous, 20 medullary, and eight papillary, were selected on the basis of their histological type in a consecutive series of 780 breast cancers. Exons 1-20 of the PIK3CA gene were subjected to SSCP analysis followed by direct sequencing. PIK3CA mutations were observed in 46 (26%) of the 180 tumours examined: 23 (50%) mutations were located in exon 9, and 23 (50%) in exon 20. Mutations were frequent in lobular (46%), less frequent in ductal (22%), and uncommon in medullary (10%), mucinous (5%), and papillary tumours (12%) (P = 0.0002). Mutations in exon 9 were more frequent in lobular carcinomas (30% of cases) than in the other histological types (less than 5% of cases) (p = 0.00014). No significant differences were observed in the distribution of mutations in exon 20. There was no significant correlation between PIK3CA mutations and other clinicopathological and biological variables, including age, tumour size, lymph node metastases, oestrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PgR) status, p53 gene mutations, and p53 protein expression. The findings indicate that in invasive breast carcinomas, PIK3CA alterations are mainly present in lobular and ductal tumours, whereas the other histological types, known to be associated with a favourable prognosis, show a very low incidence of PIK3CA mutations.

(jean.guillot@u-clermont1.fr)									Oncology Reports		2006	FEB 2006	15	2	305-310	305	310							VVA-B-4 lectin was used to investigate the differences in Tn antigen expression in tissues of different types of human breast cancer (benign lesions, carcinoma in situ, invasive carcinoma) and in normal tissues neighboring lobular carcinoma. Locations in which Tn antigen was expressed were identified using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase labeling system. Tissues collected during cosmetic procedures and classified as normal were completely negative, except for one case. Benign proliferative changes including fibroadenoma, apocrine and cylindrical metaplasia showed a very weak positive reaction, although strongly positive cells were also observed. The reaction in non-invasive cases of atypical hyperplasia was diversified depending on site. Intralobular hyperplasia was characterized by a particularly high percentage of labeled cells. A majority (up to 80%) of ductal and lobular carcinoma in situ showed very strong or moderate staining. In invasive cancers, there were Conspicuous differences between stage of cancer development and tendency towards a decrease in intensely labeled cell count in the most advanced stages. In normal tissues in the direct neighborhood of carcinoma in situ, the cytoplasm of 40% of cells was strongly labeled. However, the findings for normal tissues in the close vicinity of invasive cancer were the most surprising, since there was either no or only very weak positive reaction. It can be concluded that glycosylation modifications during carcinogenesis, as demonstrated by the presence of Tn epitope, develop very early, before any destructive changes in proliferation/apoptosis or cell differentiation become discernible.														1021-335X	1791-2431

(ljpierce@umich.edu)									Cancer		2006	JAN 1 2006	106	1	28-34	28	34							BACKGROUND. The goals of the current study were to compare the clinicopathologic presentations of patients with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) as a component of breast carcinoma who were treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) and radiation therapy (RT) with those of patients without LCIS as part of their primary tumor and to report rates of local control by overall cohort and specifically in patients with positive margins for LCIS and multifocal LCIS.METHODS. Sixty-four patients with Stages 0-II breast carcinoma with LCIS (LCIS-containing tumor group, LCTG) that had received BCS+RT treatment at the University of Michigan between 1989 and 2003 were identified. These patients were matched to 121 patients without LCIS (control group) in a 1:2 ratio.RESULTS. The median follow-up time was 3.9 years (range, 0.3-18.9 yrs). There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to clinical, pathologic, or treatment-related variables or in mammographic presentation, with the exception of a higher proportion of the LCTG patients who received adjuvant hormonal therapy (P = 0.01). The rates of local control at 5 years were 100% in the LCTG group and 99.1 % in the control group (P = 0.86). The presence of LCIS at the margins and the size and presence of multifocal LCIS did not alter the rate of local control.CONCLUSIONS. The extent of LCIS and its presence at the margins did not reduce the excellent rates of local control after BCS+RT. The data suggest that LCIS in the tumor specimen, even when multifocal, should not affect selection of patients for BCS and whole-breast RT.														0008-543X		10.1002/cncr.2005

Many surgeons now take, at the time of lumpectomy, multiple separate "cavity margins" (CM) (the entire wall of the residual cavity) as final margins that supersede the oriented lumpectomy margins (LMs). We studied the efficacy of this method in 126 patients (23 with ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] only and 103 with invasive carcinoma with or without DCIS) who had an oriented lumpectomy specimen and also had four to six additional CMs. The tumors were evaluated for the following: size, grade, LM status (distance of tumor from margin and, if involved, extent of involvement), vascular invasion, lymph node status, and presence or absence of extensive intraductal component. The additional CM specimens were evaluated for residual carcinoma (if any) and its distance from the inked true margins, and the results were correlated with the corresponding LMs. Only approximately 50% of patients (52 of 103) with histologically positive LMs (defined as carcinoma within 2 turn of the inked surface) had residual carcinoma in their CMs. Additional CM sampling rendered the overall final margin status histologically negative in 61 of 103 (59%) cases with histologically positive LMs, therefore significantly reducing the need for reexcision. Younger patient age, higher number of positive LMs, high tumor grade, and the presence of extensive intraductal component were predictive of residual carcinoma in CM specimens, whereas the distance of carcinoma from the inked surface and the extent of tumor involvement of histologically positive LMs were not. Because CM specimens taken from patients with histologically positive LMs usually lack tumor, we suspect that many positive LMs are likely false positives. Possible factors accounting for false-positive LMs include seepage of ink into crevices of the specimen promoted by excessive inking, tumor friability promoting displacement of tumor into ink, manipulation of specimens for radiographs, and retraction artifact.														0147-5185		10.1097/01.pas.0000180448.08203.70

Secondary prevention involves screening individuals who are at increased risk for breast cancer in hopes that early intervention will affect survival. In the 1980s, chemoprevention received serious attention. This approach was aimed at reducing cancer risk by administration of natural or synthetic clinical compounds that prevent, reverse, or suppress carcinogenesis in individuals at increased risk for cancer. It was not until 1998, however, when the first report from the National Surgical Adjunct Breast and Bowel Project (Breast Cancer Prevention Trial BCPT; P-1) randomized clinical trial appeared in the literature supporting the hypothesis that breast cancer can be prevented. This study showed that administration of tamoxifen reduced the risk for invasive and noninvasive breast cancer by almost 50% in all age groups. With the current availability of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent and with the increasing emphasis on early breast cancer detection and prevention, more women seek consultation to determine their risk for breast cancer. However, in the absence of any detectable breast lesion, clinically and mammographically, only a few women may volunteer to have their breasts sampled by surgical biopsy for risk assessment. Other non-surgical procedures include fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) and the recently introduced procedure, ductal lavage. These techniques may provide better alternatives. These minimally invasive procedures are capable of recruiting cellular material for cytomorphologic interpretation and biomarker studies.														0272-2712		10.1016/j.cll.2005.08.014

However, the study of lymphatic vessels and lyrnphangiogenesis has been hampered by lack of specific markers. Recently, antibodies directed against M2A (D2-40), Podoplanin, and Prox-1 that specifically mark lymphatic vessels in paraffin-embedded sections have become available. These were used to study lymphangiogenesis in archival paraffin sections of normal breast (n = 23), fibrocystic disease (n = 7), ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 32), invasive ductal carcinoma (n = 50), and invasive lobular carcinoma (n = 5). In addition, endothelial proliferation in lymphatic vessels was analyzed by dual-color immunohistochemistry with D2-40 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Expression of D2-40, Prox-1, and Podoplanin was seen in lymphatic vessels but not in blood vessels. Lymphatic vessels were seen in the peritumoral area and as "entrapped" intratumoral vessels adjacent to preexisting normal lobules and ducts. Unlike angiogenesis, there was no increase of lymphatic vessel density in association with neoplastic transformation. On the contrary, a marked reduction in intratumoral lymphatic vessel density was seen in comparison to normal breast tissue, fibrocystic disease, and ductal carcinoma in situ (P = 0.0001). There was an increase in periturnoral lymphatic vessel density as compared with normal breast (P = 0.0001). However, the endothelial cells in the "entrapped" or the periturnoral lymphatic vessels did not show any expression of PCNA indicating minimal or no proliferative activity. This was in contrast to the strong expression seen in adjacent tumor cells and blood vessel endothelial cells. Thus, lymph angiogenesis was not evident when studied by lymphatic vessel density or by lymph vessel endothelial proliferation.														0147-5185	1532-0979	10.1097/01.pas.0000174269.99459.9d

Breast cancer can be subdivided according to standard pathological parameters including histological type, grade, and assessment of proliferation. These parameters are the net result of combinations of genetic alterations effecting tumour behaviour and could potentially reflect subtypes that respond differently to endocrine treatment.Aims: To investigate the usefulness of these parameters as predictors of the response to tamoxifen in premenopausal women with breast cancer.Materials/methods: Clinically established pathological parameters were assessed and related to the tamoxifen response in 500 available tumour specimens from 564 premenopausal patients with breast cancer randomised to either two years of tamoxifen or no treatment with 14 years of follow up. Proliferation was further evaluated by immunohistochemical Ki-67 expression.Results: Oestrogen receptor positive ductal carcinomas responded as expected to tamoxifen, whereas the difference in recurrence free survival between control and tamoxifen treated patients was less apparent in the relatively few lobular carcinomas. For histological grade, there was no obvious difference in treatment response between the groups. The relation between proliferation and tamoxifen response seemed to be more complex, with a clear response in tumours with high and low proliferation, whereas tumours with intermediate proliferation defined by Ki-67 responded more poorly.Conclusions: Clinically established pathology parameters seem to mirror the endocrine treatment response and could potentially be valuable in future treatment decisions for patients with breast cancer.														0021-9746	1472-4146	10.1136/jcp.2005.027185

British Journal of Cancer		2005	OCT 31 2005	93	9	1046-1052	1046	1052							Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, though little is known about some of its rarer forms, including certain histologic types. Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program data on 135 157 invasive breast cancer cases diagnosed from 1992 to 2001, relationships between nine histologic types of breast cancer and various tumour characteristics were assessed. Among women aged 50 - 89 years at diagnosis, lobular and ductal/lobular carcinoma cases were more likely to be diagnosed with stage III/ IV, >= 5.0 cm, and node-positive tumours compared to ductal carcinoma cases. Mucinous, comedo, tubular, and medullary carcinomas were less likely to present at an advanced stage. Lobular, ductal/ lobular, mucinous, tubular, and papillary carcinomas were less likely, and comedo, medullary, and inflammatory carcinomas were more likely to be oestrogen receptor ( ER) negative/ progesterone receptor ( PR) negative and high grade ( notably, 68.2% of medullary carcinomas were ER - PR - vs 19.3% of ductal carcinomas). In general, similar differences were observed among women diagnosed at age 30 - 49 years. Inflammatory carcinomas are associated with more aggressive tumour phenotypes, and mucinous, tubular, and papillary tumours are associated with less aggressive phenotypes. The histologic types of breast cancer studied here differ greatly in their clinical presentations, and the differences in their hormone receptor profiles and grades point to their likely different aetiologies.														0007-0920	1532-1827	10.1038/sj.bjc.6602787

Epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between the risk of breast cancer and androgens. However, the functional role and clinical value of AR expression in breast carcinoma have still not been clearly defined. The present study was set up to investigate the prevalence of ARs in a series of consecutive invasive breast carcinomas (IBCs) and to evaluate the patterns of AR phenotypes in a series of selected invasive lobular carcinomas (ILCs). Among the 250 consecutive IBCs (consisting of 212 ductal and 38 lobular neoplasms), AR immunoreactivity was observed in 151/250 (60.4%) cases, being expressed in 118/212 (56%) ductal and 33/38 (87%) lobular carcinomas (a statistically significant difference, chi(2)=11.82). AR expression was frequently associated with ER (65.2%, chi(2)=14.33) and PR positivity (66.9%, chi(2)=7.36). Most AR positive cases showed a low proliferative index (63.7%) and a low or intermediate histological grade (G1-G2, 63.9%). Among the 80 selected ILCs, AR expression was observed in 64/80 (80%) cases. Our results confirm that ARs are expressed in most breast cancers. Moreover, we demonstrated that AR positivity is particularly marked in lobular neoplasms. In addition, AR positive carcinomas are frequently characterized by a low or intermediate grade, a low proliferative index and ER and/or PR co-expression.

Journal of Pathology		2005	SEP 2005	207	1	1-13	1	13							Immunohistochemical analysis of E-cadherin has changed the way lobular neoplasia is perceived. It has helped to classify difficult cases of carcinoma in situ with indeterminate features and led to the identification of new variants of lobular carcinoma. Pleomorphic lobular carcinoma (PLC) and pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (PLCIS), recently described variants of invasive and in situ classic lobular carcinoma, are reported to be associated with more aggressive clinical behaviour. Although PLC/PLCIS show morphological features of classic lobular neoplasia and lack E-cadherin expression, it is still unclear whether these lesions evolve through the same genetic pathway as lobular carcinomas or are high-grade ductal neoplasms that have lost E-cadherin. Here we have analysed a case of extensive PLCIS and invasive PLC associated with areas of E-cadherin-negative carcinoma in situ with indeterminate features, using immunohistochemistry, chromogenic in situ hybridization, high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and array-based CGH. We observed that all lesions lacked E-cadherin and beta-catenin and showed gain of 1q and loss of 16q, features that are typical of lobular carcinomas but are not seen in high-grade ductal lesions. In addition, amplifications of c-myc and HER2 were detected in the pleomorphic components, which may account for the high-grade features in this case and the reported aggressive clinical behaviour of these lesions. Taken together, these data suggest that at least some PLCs may evolve from the same precursor or through the same genetic pathway as classic lobular carcinomas.

The sensitivity of the intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel lymph node (SLN) micrometastases and the metastases of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is low. The goal of the current study was to assess whether the use of intraoperative, rapid immunohistochistochemistry (IHC) enhances the intraoperative detection of micrometastases and metastases of ILC.METHODS. The sensitivity of the intraoperative diagnosis of SLN metastasis was evaluated in 438 patients when using rapid IHC with a cytokeratin biomarker. The results were compared with those obtained for 557 patients without rapid IHC but with conventional staining.RESULTS. For patients with ILC, the sensitivity of the intraoperative diagnosis was 87% (45 of 52) in the IHC group and 66% (39 of 59) in the non-IHC group (P = 0.02). The sensitivity of the intraoperative diagnosis was similar for patients with other types of invasive cancer regardless of the use of rapid IHC. However, rapid IHC enhanced marginally the intraoperative diagnosis of the smallest micrometastases, isolated tumor cells (P = 0.06).CONCLUSIONS. Rapid IHC with cytokeratin labeling enhanced the intraoperative diagnosis of SLN metastases in patients with ILC. It may also improve the intraoperative diagnosis of micro metastases.														0008-543X		10.1002/cncr.21133

Twenty-one were benign, two were lobular carcinoma in situ, and 42 were malignant. Of the latter, 30 were identified as ductal carcinoma in situ, and 12 as invasive breast cancer. Thirty-eight of the 42 malignant cases required further treatment, and 24 of them underwent further operation. Radiological assessment of the 65 patients suggested that nine lesions were probably benign, 31 indeterminate, 20 suspicious, and five malignant. Malignancy was subsequently confirmed by histological examination in 6, 20, 13, and 3 cases of the respective group of radiological assessment.Conclusion. The biopsy rate was approximately 3.7 per 1000 screened women, with results benign in 1.19 per 1000. The positive biopsy rate was 64.6%, and invasion was evident in 28.6%.														1024-2708

Described herein are cytological and histological findings in a case of HBC. Fine-needle aspiration cytology revealed numerous loosely cohesive tumor cells with abundant foamy to granular cytoplasm and bland-appearing nuclei. The resected tumor exhibited a solid growth pattern instead of classic invasive lobular patterns observed in most reported cases of HBC. However, distinct intracytoplasmic lumina and Pagetoid extension to ducts suggested that this tumor was a variant of invasive lobular carcinoma. To determine the cause of the loose cellular cohesiveness of this HBC, its expression of the epithelium-related cell adhesion molecules E-cadherin and CD44v8-10 (CD44 epithelial variant) was examined. Immunohistochemically, E-cadherin was not detected, similar to most lobular carcinomas. Furthermore, competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses among alternatively spliced variants of CD44 revealed that the ratio of expression of CD44v8-10 to that of CD44v10 (dominant variant in leukocytes) was lower than that for the reference breast carcinoma samples. It is concluded that the present case of HBC was a solid variant of invasive lobular carcinoma exhibiting foamy to granular cytoplasmic change. Decreased expression of both E-cadherin and CD44 epithelial variant may be responsible for the loose cellular cohesiveness observed in HBC.														1320-5463		10.1111/j.1440-1827.2005.01836.x

Radiology		2005	JUN 05	235	3	791-797	791	797							PURPOSE: To retrospectively compare three different doses of gadobenate dimeglumine with a standard dose of gadopentetate dimeglumine for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evaluation of breast vessels and to evaluate the accuracy of one-sided increased vascularity seen on gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MR images as an indicator of ipsilateral breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The original study had local ethics committee approval; informed consent was obtained from all enrolled patients. Ninety-five patients known to have or suspected of having breast cancer were randomly assigned to four groups to receive gadobenate dimeglumine at a dose of 0.05, 0.10, or 0.20 mmol per kilogram of body weight or gaclopentetate dimeglumine at a dose of 0.10 mmol/kg. T1-weighted gradient-echo MR images were acquired before and 2 minutes after intravenous contrast material injection. Subtracted images were used to obtain maximum intensity projections (MIPs). Two readers blinded to the type and dose of contrast agent administered scored the Mips obtained in the dose groups for vessel number, length, and conspicuity from 0, which indicated absent or low breast vascularity, to 3, which indicated high breast vascularity. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of one-sided increased vascularity in association with ipsilateral malignancy for 69 histopathologically confirmed lesions (reference standard) were determined after gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging.RESULTS: The mean MIP scores assigned to the gaclobenate climeglumine groups were significantly higher than those assigned to the gadopentetate climeglumine group (P <=.044). Histopathologic analysis revealed malignant lesions in 52 of 69 patients examined with gaclobenate dimegiumine MR imaging: invasive ductal carcinoma in 45, invasive lobular carcinoma in four, and invasive mixed ductallobular carcinoma in three patients. Seventeen patients had benign lesions. Two cases of bilateral invasive cancer with symmetric breast vascular maps were excluded. Thus, the overall sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of one-sided increased vascularity as a finding associated with ipsilateral malignancy were 88% (44 of 50 patients), 82% (14 of 17 patients), 87% (58 of 67 patients), 94% (44 of 47 patients), and 70% (14 of 20 patients), respectively.CONCLUSION: Gaclobenate climeglumine is effective for MR imaging evaluation of breast vessels at doses as low as 0.05 mmol/kg. One-sided increased vascularity is an MR imaging finding frequently associated with ipsilateral invasive breast cancer. RSNA 2005.

Genomics of invasive ductal and lobular breast carcinomas		Turashvili, Gulisa (gturashvili@hotmail.com) ; Bouchal, Jan; Burkadze, George; Kolar, Zdenek									Biomedical Papers (Olomouc)		2005	JUN 2005	149	1	63-68	63	68							Breast cancer is considered to be a multifactorial disorder caused by both genetic and non-genetic factors. Different histological types of breast cancer differ in response to treatment and may have a divergent clinical course. Breast tissue is heterogeneous, with components of epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial and lymphopoietic derivation. The genetic heterogenity of invasive breast cancer is reflected by the wide spectrum of histological types and differentiation grades. Nevertheless, the influences of these cell types on the tumour's total pattern of gene expression can be estimated analytically. Microarrays permit total tissue analysis and provide a stable molecular portrait of tumours. Some investigations suggest differences in the gene expression profiling for ductal and lobular carcinomas. It has been reported that inactivating mutations of the E-cadherin gene are very frequent in infiltrating lobular breast carcinomas. Other than altered expression of E-cadherin, little is known about the underlying biology that distinguishes ductal and lobular tumour subtypes. However, about 8 genes have been identified differentially which are expressed in lobular and ductal cancers: E-CD, survivin, cathepsin B, TPI1, SPRY1, SCYA14, TFAP2B, and thrombospondin 4, osteopontin, HLA-G, and CHC1. Expression profiling of breast cancers can be used diagnostically to distinguish individual histologic subclassifications and may guide the selection of target therapeutics. However, future approaches will need to include methods for high throughput clinical validation and the ability to analyze microscopic samples.

(hwang@bidmc.harvard.edu)									Diagnostic Cytopathology		2005	MAY 05	32	5	276-280	276	280							Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) of the breast is a recognized marker for increased risk of invasive carcinoma and has well-established histologic criteria. However, its detection and diagnosis on FNA of breast has not been well defined. Cytology slides (all ThinPrep((R))) of 11 cases with biopsy-proven LCIS at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center were reviewed. All 11 cases showed tight and/or loosely cohesive clusters of crowded mildly enlarged nuclei and ten of 11 showed at least moderate cellularity. Single epithelial cells, small but prominent nuleoli, intracytoplasmic lumina, and two distinct epithelial-cell populations were also noted in some cases. As none of these features is specific for LCIS, it would be prudent to report such lesions as atypical so that a core biopsy or excisional biopsy will be performed before definitive treatment. The original FNA diagnosis of the 11 cases ranged from epithelial proliferation without atypia to carcinoma. Three of the 11 cases had fibroadenomas on histology with extensive involvement by LCIS. Since management for LCIS is different from that for invasive carcinoma or DCIS, it should be considered and distinguished from the latter two in cases suspicious for carcinoma on FNA. 2005 (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.														8755-1039		10.1002/dc.20247

(fomalley@mtsinai.on.ca)									Modern Pathology		2005	MAY 05	18	5	621-628	621	628							Grading of invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type using the Nottingham combined histologic grading system provides independent prognostic information. The prognostic utility of grading invasive lobular carcinomas, however, has not been fully elucidated. In addition, the relationship between grade in invasive lobular carcinomas and expression of predictive biomarkers is less certain. The purpose of this study was to correlate histologic grade in invasive lobular carcinoma with known prognostic and predictive markers. All primary resections for invasive mammary carcinomas diagnosed in Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, between the years 1996 and 2002 were reviewed (n = 1053). Of these cases, 50 were pure invasive lobular carcinoma ( incidence 4.7%). The median age at diagnosis was 64 years. These tumors were graded using the Nottingham combined histologic grading system and analyzed for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2/neu and E-cadherin expression. Tumor grade was correlated with tumor size ( P = 0.03), and the American Joint Committee on Cancer nodal status ( P = 0.05). Assessment of the individual components of grade showed that the mitotic score was highly correlated with tumor size ( P = 0.02), lymph node positivity ( P = 0.02) and overall American Joint Committee on Cancer stage ( P = 0.01). Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor were highly expressed irrespective of the grade of tumor. HER2/neu protein overexpression and E-cadherin protein expression was absent in all invasive lobular carcinomas studied. We conclude that pure invasive lobular carcinoma is uncommon and occurs predominantly in postmenopausal women. Increasing tumor grade is correlated with median tumor size and the American Joint Committee on Cancer nodal stage, but not correlated with the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, E-cadherin or HER2/neu protein overexpression.

(seewa001@mc.duke.edu)									Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention		2005	APR 05	14	4	790-798	790	798							Methylation of the retinoic acid receptor-beta 2 (RAR beta 2) P2 promoter is hypothesized to be an important mechanism for loss of RAR beta 2 function during early mammary carcinogenesis. The frequency of RAR beta 2 P2 methylation was tested in (a) 16 early stage breast cancers and (b) 67 random periareolar fine needle aspiration (RPFNA) samples obtained from 38 asymptomatic women who were at increased risk for breast cancer. Risk was defined as either (a) 5-year Gail risk calculation >= 1.7%; (b) prior biopsy exhibiting atypical hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, or ductal carcinoma in situ; or (c) known BRCA1/2 mutation carrier. RAR beta 2 P2 promoter methylation was assessed at two regions, M3 (-51 to 162 bp) and M4 (104-251 bp). In early stage cancers, M4 methylation was observed in 11 of 16 (69%) cases; in RPFNA samples, methylation was present at M3 and M4 in 28 of 56 (50%) and 19 of 56 (38%) cases, respectively. RPFNAs were stratified for cytologic atypia using the Masood cytology index. The distribution of RAR beta 2 P2 promoter methylation was reported as a function of increased cytologic abnormality. Methylation at both M3 and M4 was observed in (a) 0 of 10 (0%) of RPFNAs with Masood scores of <= 10 (nonproliferative), (b) 3 of 20 (15%) with Masood scores of 11 to 12 (low-grade proliferative), (c) 3 of 10 (30%) with Masood scores of 13 (high-grade proliferative), and (d) 7 of 14 (50%) with Masood scores of 14 of 15 (atypia). Results from this study indicate that the RAR beta 2 P2 promoter is frequently methylated (69%) in primary breast cancers and shows a positive association with increasing cytologic abnormality in RPFNA.														1055-9965		10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-04-0580																		
J	BCI:BCI200510011364	15719436			Immunohistochemically detected lymph node metastases from breast carcinoma - Practical considerations about the new American Joint Committee on cancer classification		de Mascarel, Isabelle (mascarel@bergonie.org) ; Soubeyran, Isabelle; MacGrogan, Gaetan; Picot, Veronique; Mathoulin-Pelissier, Simone									Cancer		2005	APR 1 2005	103	7	1319-1322	1319	1322							BACKGROUND. The authors applied the sixth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification system to their previously published group of patients with breast carcinoma who had immunohistochemically detected lymph node metastases.METHODS. The original lymph node-negative slides from 218 patients, including 129 patients with infiltrating duct carcinoma (IDC) and 89 patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC), were reviewed and then destained to perform immunohistochemistry. Each tumor cell deposit was measured. Single tumor cells could not counted or measured (because the distance separating the most distant cells could be > 2.0 mm), but they were separated into Class 1 (sparse) and Class 2 (numerous). According to the AJCC classification, isolated tumor cells (ITCs) should be classified as pNO(i+) when they measure <= 0.2 mm and pN1mi when they measure <= 2.0 mm but > 0.2 mm.RESULTS. ITCs were found in 13 IDCs (10%) and in 37 ILCs (41%) and corresponded in IDCs to a single deposit of a few tumor cells that measured <= 0.2 mm (associated with a single tumor cell in 3 tumors) and were classified as pN0(i+). In ILCs, ITCs corresponded to single tumor cells with an irregular distribution throughout the entire lymph node section (24 ITCs and 13 ITCs in Class 1 and Class 2, respectively) and were difficult to classify.CONCLUSIONS. The results suggest that there are 2 categories of pN0(i+): measurable tumor cell deposits <= 0.2 mm, which were found exclusively in IDCs; and nonmeasurable ITCs, which were found in ILCs and rarely in IDCs. The new classification is difficult to apply to ITCs that are detected by immunohistochemistry in ILCs.

(lill.tove.busund@unn.no) ; Richardsen, E.; Busund, R.; Ukkonen, T.; Bjornsen, T.; Busch, C.; Stalsberg, H.									Journal of Clinical Pathology (London)		2005	April 2005	58	4	361-366	361	366							Background/Aim: Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) play a role in the normal development of breast tissue, and possibly in breast cancer aetiology. IGFBP2, one of six members of the IGFBP superfamily, acts as regulator of the IGFs and has pleiotropic effects in normal and neoplastic tissues. Because IGFs have mitogenic effects on mammary epithelia, this study investigated IGFBP2 expression in mammary tissues of different benign and malignant entities. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to study correlations between the presence and intensity of IGFBP2 staining and tumour type and grade, in addition to steroid hormone receptor status, in 120 breast specimens. Expression was measured by quantitative colour video image analysis and semiquantitative evaluation, and the measurements correlated well (r = 0.92; p 0.05). Results: Both methods found no significant expression of IGFBP2 in normal glandular cells and hyperplasia (group I). Atypical hyperplasia showed a slightly increased cytoplasmic expression of IGFBP2, and carcinoma in situ showed a distinctive, membrane associated and cytoplasmic expression (group II). Infiltrating carcinomas strongly expressed cytoplasmic IGFBP2 (group III). There were significant differences between group I and II, and between group II and III. There were no significant differences between invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma, or between grades I, II, and III within these entities. There was no significant correlation between IGFBP2 immunostaining and oestrogen or progesterone receptor positivity within the malignant group. Conclusions: IGFBP2 mitogenic signals of autocrine/paracrine regulatory mechanisms may be responsible for the growth of breast carcinomas and IGFBP2 may be an independent indicator of malignancy.														0021-9746		10.1136/jcp.2004.020834

Annals of Saudi Medicine		2005	MAR-APR 2005	25	2	111-114	111	114							BACKGROUND: The sentinal node biopsy (SNB) is a reliable method for determining the status of the regional lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer. SNB technology is evolving rapidly, but no standardization has yet been accomplished. The aim of this study is to discuss the accuracy of this procedure and the optimal method for identifying micrometastases.METHODS: We collected data from 70 women with primary invasive breast carcinoma who underwent SNB for breast cancer. We examined two frozen sections levels from each half of each lymph node, as well as a cytology imprint before arriving at the frozen section diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry with pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3) was done on the paraffin sections. For the association between the lymph node size and the possibility of metastases, Student's t test was used and a P value of less than 0.05 was regarded as significant.RESULTS: The number of patients with metastases in SNB was 19, from which 15 cases were correctly diagnosed in frozen sections/imprints and four cases were false negative. The axillary toilet from all cases with SNB metastases smaller than 2 mm showed no additional positive nodes. Lymph node diameter showed a significant association with sentinel node status (P < 0.0001).CONCLUSION: Frozen section examination of SNB from patients with breast carcinoma is both specific (100%) and sensitive (79%). Diagnosis of lobular carcinoma can be difficult, and may require immunohistochemistry with cytokeratin for diagnosis. Small metastases in a non-optimal frozen section may be difficult to discern. Cytology imprints add nothing to the diagnosis.														0256-4947	1319-9226	10.5144/0256-4947.2005.111

(lpmiddleton@mdanderson.org) ; Wang, Sijan; Valero, Vicente; Sahin, Aysegul									Cancer		2005	March 1, 2005	103	5	900-905	900	905							BACKGROUND. Although p53 and HER-2/neu overexpression are found in 30% of breast carcinomas in women of all ages and are associated with high rates of lymph node metastases, their role in women age < 30 years has not been studied 2. extensively. METHODS. The institutional breast cancer data base was searched to identify young women (23-30 years) with breast carcinoma. An immunohistochemical analysis was performed to determine estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expression and p53 and HER-2/neu overexpression. Positive staining for p53 was defined as nuclear staining in > 10% of tumor cells. HER-2/neu membranous staining was graded as 0, 1 (incomplete, faint staining in > 10% of cells), 2 (weak-to-moderate, complete staining in > 10% of cells), or 3 (complete, strong staining in > 10% of cells). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed oil all samples with gtoreq and gtoreq results, and only FISH-positive samples were classified as positive. The overexpression was correlated with clinicopathologic features. RESULTS. Among 44 patients, I patient bad medullary carcinoma, and I had mixed ductal/lobular carcinoma. All remaining patients were diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. The clinical stage was T1 in 5 patients, T2 in 24 patients, T3 in 10 patients, T4 in 4 patients, and unavailable in I patient. Positive p53 status was determined in 22 of 44 patients (50%), and positive HER-2/neu status was determined in 18 of 41 patients (44%). Tumors with lymph node metastasis had a significantly greater incidence of HER-2/neu overexpression (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS. Frequent overexpression of HER-2/neu and p53 was found in the patient population. HER-2/neu overexpression was associated significantly with lymph node involvement and, thus, may be a market for aggressive clinical behavior in patients with breast carcinoma age ltoreq 30 years.

Metastases to the uterus are rare. accounting for less than 10% of all cases of metastases; to the female genital tract from extragenital cancers. The endometrium is even less frequently affected by metastases, Lobular carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer that metastasizes to the uterus. Cases. Two cases of infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast metastatic to endometrium and myometrium. one of them harboring an endometrioid adenocarcinoma, are reported. Both patients were on tamoxifen therapy and presented with uterine bleeding. Conclusion. To the best of our knowledge, uterine carcinoma serving as recipient of metastatic carcinoma front the breast has not been previously documented.

British Journal of Cancer		2005	January 31, 2005	92	2	231-235	231	235							The objective of this one- institutional study was to determine the number of large- core needle biopsies ( LCNB), under three-dimensional ultrasound ( 3D- US) validation, that are sufficient to obtain a reliable histological diagnosis of a sonographically detectable breast lesion. Over an 28- month period, 962 sonographically guided LCNB were performed under 3D- US validation to assess 962 breast lesions. All biopsies were carried out with an automated core biopsy device fitted with 14- gauge ( 22mm excursion) needles. Data of 962 biopsied breast lesions were gathered. Surgical follow- up was available for 659 lesions. Breast malignancies were diagnosed by ultrasound- guided LCNB with a sensitivity of 98.2% by performing three cores per lesion. In few cases, the open surgical specimen revealed the presence of invasive carcinomas in contrast to initial LNCB- based classification as ductal carcinomas in situ ( DCIS, 11 lesions), lobular carcinoma in situ ( one lesion), and atypical ductal hyperpasia ( one lesion). Owing to disagreement between classification based on breast- imaging and histological findings, eight of these tumours were subsequently excised. Of the lesions that were removed at the patients' requests despite benign LCNB diagnosis, two were infiltrating carcinoma and one a DCIS. We demonstrate that three 3D- US- guided percutaneous core specimens are sufficient to achieve tissue for a reliable histological assessment of sonographically detectable breast lesions and allow the detection of malignancies with high sensitivity and low rate of false- negative diagnoses.														0007-0920

By doing suppression subtractive hybridization to detect differentially expressed genes between the breast cancer cell line CAL51 and a nontumorigenic microcell hybrid CAL/17-1, we identified the gene for the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor associated protein (GABARAP), located on 17p13.1. GABARAP displayed high expression levels in the microcell hybrid CAL/17-1 but only weak expression in CAL51 and other breast cancer cell lines tested. Furthermore, we observed large vesicles in CAL/17-1 by immunofluorescence staining, whereas no signal could be detected in the tumor cell line. GABARAP mRNA expression and protein expression were significantly down-regulated in invasive ductal and invasive lobular carcinomas compared with normal breast tissue measured by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. We assessed that neither mutations in the coding region of the gene nor hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region are responsible for loss of gene expression in CAL51; however, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment was effective in gene up-regulation, suggesting a methylation-dependent upstream effect. Stable transfection of GABARAP into CAL51 resulted in an increase of gene expression and remarkably influenced the ability of colony formation in soft agar and the growth rate in vitro and, moreover, suppressed the tumorigenicity of the cells in nude mice. In summary, our data suggest that GABARAP acts via a vesicle transport mechanism as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer.														0008-5472

S.; Al-Talib, R. K.; Theaker, J. M. (jtheaker@doctors.net.uk)									Histopathology (Oxford)		2005	January 2005	46	1	50-56	50	56							Aims: To describe a series of 10 cases of transitional cell carcinoma which show morphological features which mimic lobular carcinoma of the breast and diffuse carcinoma of the stomach. Methods and results: Ten cases were identified from the files at Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust and from the authors' consultation files. Immunostains were performed and clinical information was obtained. Eight of the patients were male and two female. Ages ranged from 52 to 77 years at presentation. All of the tumours showed areas where the tumour was composed of uniform cells with a discohesive single-cell, diffusely invasive growth pattern. In areas the tumour cells were arranged in linear single-cell files and in separate areas solid sheets of discohesive cells. In all of the cases some tumour cells showed prominent intracytoplasmic vacuoles. In addition to this pattern, four cases showed typical transitional cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ. The majority of the tumours expressed cytokeratin 20 but not oestrogen receptors. Conclusion: This study highlights a pattern of diffusely invasive transitional cell carcinoma not previously described and one which is important to recognize in order to avoid misdiagnosis of metastatic lobular carcinoma of the breast, especially in small biopsies.														0309-0167		10.1111/j.1365-2559.2005.02051.x

ILC is difficult to diagnose mammographically as tumors can be present as architectural distortion, asymmetries, or low-density masses. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the detection of ILC using a computer-aided detection system (CAD). We reviewed 81 consecutive cases of ILC diagnosed by our clinic in a 2(1/2) year period. We collected the following: visibility of cancer on current or prior mammograms, whether CAD marked the cancer on one or both mammographic views (craniocaudal, CC and mediolateral oblique, MLO) in current and prior studies, tumor size, nuclear grade, and lymph node involvement. Results reveal that 65% of the cancers was marked by CAD the year of diagnosis and 26% of cancers were marked by CAD the prior year. Mean mammographic size in the current year was 1.7 cm and 1.0 cm in the prior year. At surgery, the mean tumor size was 2.1 cm and nuclear grade was reported as 43% Grade I, 53% Grade II, and 4% Grade III. Positive lymph node involvement was reported in 33%. Overall, CAD may be helpful as an adjunct to mammography for ILC diagnosis. (c) 2005 CARS & Elsevier B.V.

J	BCI:BCI200500164336	15641021			Molecular evolution of breast cancer		Simpson, Peter T.; Reis-Filho, Jorge S.; Gale, Theodora; Lakhani, Sunil R. (s.lakhoni@uq.edu.au)									Journal of Pathology		2005	January 2005	205	2	248-254	248	254							Molecular analysis of invasive breast cancer and its precursors has furthered our understanding of breast cancer progression. In the past few years, new multi-step pathways of breast cancer progression have been delineated through genotypic-phenotypic correlations. Nuclear grade, more than any other pathological feature, is strongly associated with the number and pattern of molecular genetic abnormalities in breast cancer cells. Thus, there are two distinct major pathways to the evolution of low- and high-grade invasive carcinomas: whilst the former consistently show oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) positivity and 16q loss, the latter are usually ER/PgR-negative and show Her-2 over-expression/amplification and complex karyotypes. The boundaries between the evolutionary pathways of well-differentiated/low-grade ductal and lobular carcinomas have been blurred, with changes in E-cadherin expression being one of the few distinguishing features between the two. In addition, lesions long thought to be precursors of breast carcinomas, such as hyperplasia of usual type, are currently considered mere risk indicators, whilst columnar cell lesions are now implicated as non-obligate precursors of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and well-differentiated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). However, only through the combination of comprehensive morphological analysis and cutting-edge molecular tools can this knowledge be translated into clinical practice and patient management.

JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association)		2004	December 8, 2004	292	22	2735-2742	2735	2742							Context Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to have high sensitivity for cancer detection and is increasingly used following mammography to evaluate suspicious breast lesions. Objective To determine the accuracy of breast MRI in conjunction with mammography for the detection of breast cancer in patients with suspicious mammographic or clinical findings. Design, Setting, and Patients Prospective multicenter investigation of the International Breast MR Consortium conducted at 14 university hospitals in North America and Europe from June 2, 1998, through October 31, 2001, of 821 patients referred for breast biopsy for American College of Radiology category 4 or 5 mammographic assessment or suspicious clinical or ultrasound finding. Interventions MRI examinations performed prior to breast biopsy; MRI results were interpreted at each site, which were blinded to pathological results. Main Outcome Measures Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of breast MRI. Results Among the 821 patients, there were 404 malignant index lesions, of which 63 were ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 341 were invasive carcinoma. Of the 417 nonmalignant index lesions, 366 were benign, 47 showed atypical histology, and 4 were lobular carcinoma in situ. The AUC pooled over all institutions was 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.86-0.91). MRI correctly detected cancer in 356 of 404 cancer cases (DCIS or invasive cancer), resulting in a sensitivity of 88.1% (95% CI, 84.6%-91.1%), and correctly identified as negative for cancer 281 of 417 cases without cancer, resulting in a specificity of 67.7% (95% CI, 62.7%-71.9%). MRI performance was not significantly affected by mammographic breast density, tumor histology, or menopausal status. The positive predictive values for 356 of 492 patients was 72.4% (95% CI, 68.2%-76.3%) and of mammography for 367 of 695 patients was 52.8% (95% CI, 49.0%-56.6%) (P.005). Dynamic MRI did not improve the AUC compared with 3-dimensional MRI alone, but the specificity of a washout pattern for 123 of 136 patients without cancer was 90.4% (95% CI, 84%-95%). Conclusions Breast MRI has high sensitivity but only moderate specificity independent of breast density, tumor type, and menopausal status. Although the positive predictive value of MRI is greater than mammography, MRI does not obviate the need for subsequent tissue sampling in this setting.

(pporter@fhcrc.org)									Cancer Research		2004	December 1, 2004	64	23	8541-8549	8541	8549							In this study, we performed high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization with an array of 4153 bacterial artificial chromosome clones to assess copy number changes in 44 archival breast cancers. The tumors were flow sorted to exclude non-tumor DNA and increase our ability to detect gene copy number changes. In these tumors, losses were more frequent than gains, and gains in 1q and loss in 16q were the most frequent alterations. We compared gene copy number changes in the tumors based on histologic subtype and estrogen receptor (ER) status, i.e., ER-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma, ER-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and ER-positive infiltrating lobular carcinoma. We observed a consistent association between loss in regions of 5q and ER-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma, as well as more frequent loss in 4p16, 8p23, 8p21, 10q25, and 17p11.2 in ER-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma compared with ER-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma (adjusted P values ltoreq 0.05). We also observed high-level amplifications in ER-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma in regions of 8q24 and 17q12 encompassing the c-myc and c-erbB-2 genes and apparent homozygous deletions in 3p21, 5q33, 8p23, 8p21, 9q34, 16q24, and 19q13. ER-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma showed a higher frequency of gain in 16p13 and loss in l6q21 than ER-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Correlation analysis highlighted regions of change commonly seen together in ER-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma. ER-positive infiltrating lobular carcinoma differed from ER-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma in the frequency of gain in 1q and loss in 11q and showed high-level amplifications in 1q32, 8p23, 11q13, and 11q14. These results indicate that array comparative genomic hybridization can identify significant differences in the genomic alterations between subtypes of breast cancer.														0008-5472		10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1992

(jpbrockway@novanthealth.org) ; Carruthers, William B. (wbcarrut@uncc.edu)									Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics		2004	December 2004	28	8	435-444	435	444							Mammography is currently regarded as the most effective and widely used method for early detection of breast cancer, but recently its sensitivity in certain high risk cases has been less than desired. The use of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) has gained considerable attention in the past 10 years, especially for high risk cases, for smaller multi-focal lesions, or very sparsely distributed lesions. In this work, we present an interactive visualization system to identify, process, visualize and quantify lesions from DCE-MRI volumes. Our approach has the following key features: (1) we determine a confidence measure for each voxel, representing the probability that the voxel is part of the tumor, using a rough goodness-of-fit for the shape of the intensity-time curves, (2) our system takes advantage of low-cost, readily available 3D texture mapping hardware to produce both 2D and 3D visualizations of the segmented MRI volume in near real-time, enabling improved spatial perception of the tumor location, shape, size, distribution, and other characteristics useful in staging and treatment courses, and (3) our system permits interactive manipulation of the signal-time curves, adapts to different tumor types and morphology, thus making it a powerful tool for radiologists/physicians to rapidly assess probable malignant volumes. We illustrate the application of our system with four case studies: invasive ductal cancer, benign fibroadenoma, ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma.

Radiology		2004	December 2004	233	3	830-849	830	849							Purpose: To prospectively assess accuracy of mammography, clinical examination, ultrasonography (US), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in preoperative assessment of local extent of breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval and informed patient consent were obtained. Results of bilateral mammography, US, and contrast-enhanced MR imaging were analyzed from 111 consecutive women with known or suspected invasive breast cancer. Results were correlated with histopathologic findings. Results: Analysis included 177 malignant foci in 121 cancerous breasts, of which 89 (50%) foci were palpable. Median size of 139 invasive foci was 18 mm (range, 2-107 mm). Mammographic sensitivity decreased from 100% in fatty breasts to 45% in extremely dense breasts. Mammographic sensitivity was highest for invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in 89 of 110 (81%) cases versus 10 of 29 (34%) cases of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) (P.001) and 21 of 38 (55%) cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (P.01). US showed higher sensitivity than did mammography for IDC, depicting 104 of 110 (94%) cases, and for ILC, depicting 25 of 29 (86%) cases (P.01 for each). US showed higher sensitivity for invasive cancer than DCIS (18 of 38 (47%),P.001). MR showed higher sensitivity than did mammography for all tumor types (P.01) and higher sensitivity than did US for DCIS (P.001), depicting 105 of 110 (95%) cases of IDC, 28 of 29 (96%) cases of ILC, and 34 of 38 (89%) cases of DCIS. In anticipation of conservation or no surgery after mammography and clinical examination in 96 breasts, additional tumor ( which altered surgical approach) was present in 30. Additional tumor was depicted in 17 of 96 (18%) breasts at US and in 29 of 96 (30%) at MR, though extent was now overestimated in 12 of 96 (12%) at US and 20 of 96 (21%) at MR imaging. After combined mammography, clinical examination, and US, MR depicted additional tumor in another 12 of 96 (12%) breasts and led to overestimation of extent in another six (6%); US showed no detection benefit after MR imaging. Bilateral cancer was present in 10 of 111 (9%) patients; contralateral tumor was depicted mammographically in six and with both US and MR in an additional three. One contralateral cancer was demonstrated only clinically. Conclusion: In nonfatty breasts, US and MR imaging were more sensitive than mammography for invasive cancer, but both MR imaging and US involved risk of overestimation of tumor extent. Combined mammography, clinical examination, and MR imaging were more sensitive than any other individual test or combination of tests.

Methods: Nine hundred and twenty-six cases of fine needle aspirates cytological specimens of the breast were studied, 289 of which were breast cancer, including susceptible cases; among the 289 cases, 8 were diagnosed as invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) by HE histological sections. Imaging analysis system was used to evaluate the cell morphology. Moreover, some aspects of ILC were compared with other types of breast cancer. Results: The incidence of ILC in breast cancer amounts to 2.8% (8/289). The cell morphology is anatomically and cytologically special for diagnosis. Compared to other types of breast cancer in the smear samples, there is no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). Conclusion: The subclassification of ILC can be made by fine needle aspiration in most of the cases. ILC may coexist with the invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), so it must he prudential to subclassify further for the routine pathological diagnosis.														1000-8179

Methods 55 cases of formalin-fixed paraffin-embeded malignant and benign breast cancinoma were detected using immunohistochemical method with the monoclonal antibody against survivin, p53 and PCNA. Results Expression of survivin, p53 and PCNA was 90%, 37. 5% and 100%, respectively. The difference between malignant and benign breast carcinoma was significant (P = 0.001). There was no significant correlation between survivin expression and age and p53 (P > 0.05). There was significant correlation between survivin expression and histologic type. The difference between mucinous, medullary carcinoma and invasive ductal, lobular carcinoma was significant (P 0.05). Survivin expression was strongly associated with PCNA. It suggested that in breast cancinoma, tumor cells were inclined to jproliferation and not apoptosis. Conclusions Over-expression of survivin, PCNA and frequent mutation of p53 may inhibit apoptotic pathway. They may be involved in the development and poor progress of breast carcinoma. The results suggest that apoptosis inhibition by survivin, alone or in cooperation with mutant p53 and PCNA may induce poor outcome in breast carcinoma.

We report a case of intraperitoneal carcinomatosis of a lobular breast carcinoma that metastasized primarily to the peritoneum, with a subsequent abdominal wall invasion at the trocar site following laparoscopic surgery for the exclusion of an ovarian carcinoma. Discussion. Port-site metastases (PSM) have occurred after laparoscopic surgery for endometrial, fallopian tube, ovarian, and cervical cancers. This is the first report of PSM of a lobular breast carcinoma primarily metastasized to the abdominal cavity. Every surgeon should be aware of the metastatic pattern of breast cancer, especially in relation to its histological subtypes. This case report emphasizes that PSM can occur in various kinds of gynecologic tumors, including breast cancer. Copyright 2004 Elsevier Inc.

J	BCI:BCI200500022638	15354217			Expression of the transcription factor CTCF in invasive breast cancer: a candidate gene located at 16q22.1		Rakha, E. A.; Pinder, S. E.; Paish, C. E.; Ellis, I. O. (ian.ellis@nottingham.ac.uk)									British Journal of Cancer		2004	October 18, 2004	91	8	1591-1596	1591	1596							CTCF is a ubiquitous 11-zinc-finger protein that plays a role in gene silencing or activation, chromatin insulation and genomic imprinting. The CTCF gene has been mapped to the chromosome band 16q22.1 that shows frequent loss of heterozygosity in breast cancer. The E-cadherin gene is the known tumour suppressor gene (TSG) at this region in lobular carcinomas; however, the target gene in the more frequent ductal tumours is still unknown. Since CTCF targets include TSGs and oncogenes and it has the ability to inhibit cell growth and proliferation, it has been suggested that it may be the target gene at the 16q22.1 in ductal carcinomas. In the present study, tissue microarray technology was used to study the expression pattern of CTCF immunohistochemically in 344 cases of invasive breast carcinoma and its expression was correlated with clinicopathological variables and patient outcome. Results showed that breast tissues express CTCF in the parenchymal cells of the normal ducts and lobules but with a variable percentage of positive cells. Staining of CTCF was detected in the nuclei and cytoplasm of the malignant cells, but no significant loss or decrease of expression was noticed in association with any specific tumour type. There was a significant correlation between expression of CTCF and histological grades; lower expression was associated with grade 3 tumours. Cytoplasmic expression was associated with increased tumour size and with the presence of vascular invasion. However, no association was found between CTCF expression and tumour type, lymph node stage, oestrogen receptor expression or patient outcome. In conclusion, the current results show that CTCF, although it may play a role in breast carcinogenesis, is unlikely to be the TSG targeted by the 16q22.1 loss in breast cancer and thus another gene or genes at this region remain to be identified.

British Journal of Cancer		2004	October 4, 2004	91	7	1263-1268	1263	1268							We analysed the 5-year relative survival among 4473 breast cancer cases diagnosed in 1990-1992 from cancer registries in Estonia, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the UK. Among eight categories based on ICD-O codes (infiltrating ductal carcinoma, lobular plus mixed carcinoma, comedocarcinoma, 'special types', medullary carcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS) carcinoma, other carcinoma and cancer without microscopic confirmation), the 5-year relative survival ranged from 66% (95% CI 61-71) for NOS carcinoma to 95% (95% CI 90-100) for special types (tubular, apocrine, cribriform, papillary, mucinous and signet ring cell); 27% (95% CI 18-36) for cases without microscopic confirmation. Differences in 5-year relative survival by tumor morphology and hormone receptor status were modelled using a multiple regression approach based on generalised linear models. Morphology and hormone receptor status were confirmed as significant survival predictors in this population-based study, even after adjusting for age and stage at diagnosis.

Breast		2004	October 2004	13	5	389-396	389	396							The treatment and outcomes for 182 patients with lobular carcinoma were compared with 1612 patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma managed concurrently at The Strathfield Breast Centre. The lobular carcinomas were larger (P<0.0001) but of lower grade (P<0.0001). Diagnosis with mammography and FNA was less sensitive in ILC (mammography P = 0.0002, FNA P<0.0001). Although similar numbers of patients underwent initial attempted conservation, patients with ILC were more likely to have positive margins at attempted breast conservation surgery and the final mastectomy rate was higher (58.2% ILC versus 47% IDC, P = 0.0041). Of the patients who had successful conservation, the local recurrence rates for ILC (3.9%) were equivalent to the patients with IDC (5.3%). There was no significant difference in overall survival (90% ILC, 87% IDC, median follow-up 3.6 years ILC, 4.3 years IDC) or disease free survival (87.9% ILC, 81.6% IDC). Although mastectomy is more likely to be necessary to obtain clear margins, breast conservation therapy is reasonable in patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma where clear margins can be obtained.

Both parameters were also studied in normal glandular structures obtained from normal breasts or from breasts containing pre-invasive lesions. Increased vascularization was present in all lesion types (MVD mean values (expressed as vessel number/mm2): 115 +/- 8 in normal lobules, 146 +/- 26 in lesions; p 0.05) and increased with lesion severity. In ductal lesions, MVDs were significantly higher in PDIC (190 +/- 65) and IDIC (167 +/- 61) than in FDHUT (123 +/- 40) and ADH (122 +/- 47); MVD was much higher in PDIC than in WDIC (p 0.001). WDIC showed peculiar features, with a degree of vascularization closer to hyperplasia than to the other histological types of in situ ductal cancer; this observation is in line with the hypothesis that IDIC and PDIC may originate 'de novo', without a mandatory transition through WDIC. LCIS was more vascularized than ALH (168 +/- 50 and 125 +/- 40, respectively; p 0.05), showing MVD values similar to those of PDIC and IDIC. The vascularization of normal lobules was constant, regardless of their association with lesions. VEGF expression in normal glandular structures was lower than in lesions, with the highest levels found in ductal lesions when compared with lobular lesions. No correlation was found between VEGF expression and the degree and/or type of vascularization. Copyright (C) 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

J	BCI:BCI200500016044	15351094			Oncogenic pathways in hereditary and sporadic breast cancer		Kenemans, P. (Kenemans@vumc.nl) ; Verstraeten, R. A.; Verheijen, R. H. M.									Maturitas		2004	September 24, 2004	49	1	34-43	34	43							Cancer is a genetic disease. Breast cancer tumorigenesis can be described as a multi-step process in which each step is thought to correlate with one or more distinct mutations in major regulatory genes. The question addressed is how far a multi-step progression model for sporadic breast cancer would differ from that for hereditary breast cancer. Hereditary breast cancer is characterized by an inherited susceptibility to breast cancer on basis of an identified germline mutation in one allele of a high penetrance susceptibility gene (such as BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK 2, TP53 or PTEN). Inactivation of the second allele of these tumour suppressor genes would be an early event in this oncogenic pathway (Knudson's "two-hit" model). Sporadic breast cancers result from a serial stepwise accumulation of acquired and uncorrected mutations in somatic genes, without any germline mutation playing a role. Mutational activation of oncogenes, often coupled with non-mutational inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, is probably an early event in sporadic tumours, followed by more, independent mutations in at least four or five other genes, the chronological order of which is likely less important. Oncogenes that have been reported to play an early role in sporadic breast cancer are MYC, CCND1 (Cyclin D1) and ERBB2 (HER2/neu). In sporadic breast cancer, mutational inactivation of BRCA1/2 is rare, as inactivation requires both gene copies to be mutated or totally deleted. However, non-mutational functional suppression could result from various mechanisms, such as hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter or binding of BRCA2 by EMSY. In sporadic breast tumorigenesis, at least three different pathway-specific mechanisms of turnout progression are recognizable, with breast carcinogenesis being different in ductal versus lobular carcinoma, and in well differentiated versus poorly differentiated ductal cancers. Thus, different breast cancer pathways emerge early in the process of carcinogenesis, ultimately leading to clinically different tumour types. As mutations acquired early during tumorigenesis will be present in all later stages, large-scale gene expression profiling using DNA microarray analysis techniques can help to classify breast cancers into clinically relevant subtypes.

Heather; Rosner, Bernard; Sluss, Patrick; Hankinson, Susan E.									Cancer Research		2004	September 15, 2004	64	18	6814-6819	6814	6819							Prolactin is important in human breast development, and substantial laboratory and in vitro data suggest a role in mammary carcinogenesis. Therefore, we conducted a prospective case-control study nested within the Nurses' Health Study cohort to examine, in detail, the association between plasma prolactin concentrations and postmenopausal breast cancer by cancer invasiveness, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor status, and other subject characteristics, including postmenopausal hormone use. Blood samples were collected from 1989 to 1990 and prolactin was measured by microparticle enzyme immunoassay. The analysis included 851 cases of postmenopausal breast cancer diagnosed after blood collection and before June 2000, in which there were one or two controls (n = 1,275) matched on age, postmenopausal hormone use, fasting status, and time of day and month of blood collection. Prolactin was associated with a modestly increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (relative risk, top versus bottom quartile, 1.34; 95% confidence interval (0), 1.02-1.76; P-trend = 0.011. The association differed by estrogen receptor/ progesterone receptor status (P-heterogeneity = 0.03). The relative risk was 1.78 (95% CI, 1.28, 2.50; P-trend < 0.001) for estrogen receptor+/ progesterone receptor+, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.43, 1.32; P-trend = 0.28) for estrogen receptor -/progesterone receptor-, and 1.94 (95% CI, 0.99,3.78; P-trend = 0.12) for estrogen receptor+ /progesterone receptor- breast cancers. Associations generally were similar for ductal and lobular carcinomas (P-heterogeneity = 0.43) and by tumor size (P-heterogeneity = 0.24). Among estrogen receptor +/progesterone receptor+ cancers, the association did not significantly differ by postmenopausal hormone use, years between blood draw and diagnosis, or after adjustment for estradiol (relative risk, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.16, 3.22; P-trend = 0.01). Our prospective data suggest that plasma prolactin concentrations are associated with an increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, particularly for estrogen receptor+ /progesterone receptor+ cancers, and independently of estradiol.

Twenty womens with breast cancer (15 invasive ductal carcinomas and 5 invasive lobular carcinomas) T2 (n = 8) or T3 (n = 12) were evaluated by physical examination and MRI after a minimal of three courses of FEC and prior to surgery. Data from physical examination and imaging studies were compared to histopathological findings. Physical examination estimated correctly the residual tumor size in 45% of cases and MRI in 60% with 3 false negative cases. Among evaluated patients with MRI mesurable residual tumor, tumor size was underestimated in 69% of the cases and overestimated in 31% of the cases. A MRC flattening was observed in 5 cases among the patients with a partial response or clinical stable disease correlated with a poor cellular density in the microscopic findings. MRI monitoring of chemotherapy response can be useful for guiding surgery. Therefore, underestimation of the residual tumor size and false negative rate are remaining problems.

(SKhan@nmff.org)									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2004	August 2004	86	3	259-268	259	268							Rodent studies suggest a relationship between lobular maturation and breast cancer risk. Human data are sparse, and were developed using whole mounts of mastectomy or mammoplasty samples, without consideration of menstrual phase in premenopausal women. We studied normal breast lobules in relation to cancer risk in 284 women, using surgical biopsy material (mean two sections and 43.2 lobular structures per subject): 167 were premenopausal; 89 with breast cancer (cases) and 78 undergoing benign breast biopsy (controls). Of 117 postmenopausal women, 67 were cases and 50 were controls. Normal lobular type was classified based on size, and was designated predominant if it constituted 60% or more of the total lobules classified. The control group showed 66% type I, 34% type II and 1% type III lobules while cases showed 69% type I, 31% type II and 7% type III structures. Predominant lobule type showed no association with cancer (p = 0.9). Postmenopausal women had a substantially higher proportion of type I lobules compared to premenopausal women, irrespective of the parity or cancer status (p 0.001). Lobule type was not associated with menstrual phase classified by dates; however, when menstrual phase was classified using breast morphological characteristics, type I lobules were more abundant in follicular phase and type II in the luteal phase (p 0.001). In conclusion, we did not observe a relationship between lobular architecture and breast cancer susceptibility when using smaller breast samples usually available in epidemiological studies, but these data highlight the need for menstrual phase strati. cation in future investigations.														0167-6806		10.1023/B:BREA.0000036899.97114.b3

To identify causative factors, we reviewed the cytologic features of presurgical FNAB smears of ILC and correlated the cytologic findings with the number of passes, tumor size, mammographic findings, and the histologic characteristics of the tumor. Smear cellularity, presence of single intact epithelial cells, nuclear size, nuclear atypia, palpability of the tumor, and histologic type of ILC (classic versus nonclassic) were statistically significant in establishing an unequivocally positive diagnosis. We also found that the cytologic cellularity of the lesion does not reflect the actual cellularity of the tumor but instead is an indicator of the architectural arrangement of the neoplastic cells; tumors that form epithelial cell groups, such as in nonclassic ILC, tend to yield more cellular aspirates that are diagnostic for carcinoma. In contrast, classic ILC, in which single neoplastic cells are embedded in fibrous stroma, is more likely to yield a paucicellular smear with subtle atypia and rare single intact epithelial cells. As such, an inconclusive diagnosis in a certain percentage of classic ILC cases may be unavoidable. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.														8755-1039		10.1002/dc.20084

(donald.weaver@uvm.odu)									Modern Pathology		2004	August 2004	17	8	905-910	905	910							Establishing an accurate primary invasive breast cancer size is crucial for patient management. Although ultrasonographic measurement is reported to correlate reliably with the gold standard pathology measurement, few authors have examined the influence of histologic subtype on ultrasound measurement. The common subtypes of invasive breast carcinoma, ductal and lobular, have different growth patterns, which may influence the ability of ultrasound to predict pathologic size. For this analysis, ultrasound and pathology reports were retrospectively reviewed for 204 women with 210 invasive breast cancers, including 129 ductal, 41 lobular, and 40 mixed pattern ductal and lobular carcinomas. For each tumor, the largest pathology and ultrasound dimensions were compared using Pearson's correlations, linear regression, paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests, stratified bit histologic subtype. The Hodges-Lehmann approach was used to obtain 95% confidence intervals (Cl) for median difference of the sizes. Ultrasonography consistently underestimated pathologic tumor size; the overall median difference was 3.5 mm (Cl: 2.5-4.0 mm) and for subtypes: 2.5 mm (Cl: 1.5-3.5 mm) for ductal pattern; 3.0 mm (Cl: 1.5-4.5 mm) for mixed pattern; and in contrast, 7.5 mm (Cl: 5.0-13.5 mm) for lobular pattern tumors. Significant correlations of similar magnitude, were observed between size measurements for ductal., lobular, and mixed subtypes (r=0.816, 0.811 and 0.672, respectively; all P0.001); however, linear regression models differed between subtypes. Although practical and widely available, ultrasonography tends to underestimate pathologic tumor size. The size difference may be large for lobular carcinomas, potentially influencing stage; differences are less pronounced for ductal and mixed subtypes. Pathologic tumor size can be estimated from the ultrasonographic measurement, particularly if the histologic tumor subtype is known. The results of this study underscore the continued benefit of pretreatment tumor histology.				Pritt, Bobbi/0000-0003-0261-1326										0893-3952		10.1038/modpathol.3800138

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2004	July 2004	86	1	31-37	31	37							Purpose. To determine the value of MR imaging in the detection and measurement of tumor size in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) compared to mammography and ultrasound. Materials and methods. From 36 cases of ILC in 34 patients who were surgically treated, the pre-operative imaging measurements, being mammography, ultrasound and contrast enhanced MR, were retrospectively re-evaluated for tumor detection and size. Findings were compared with pathology. Two radiologists were used for evaluation of the mammograms, the other imaging modalities were only evaluated by one radiologist. The Pearsons correlation test was used to determine the correlation between histopathological and imaging measurements for each imaging modality. Results. For mammography, ultrasound and MRI the false negative scores were respectively 14%, 3% and 0%. The percentage for underestimated, correctly estimated and overestimated measurements on imaging were 56%, 33% and 11% for radiologist 1 and 50%, 33% and 17% for radiologist 2 on mammography. For ultrasound and MRI these percentages were respectively 53%, 47%, 0% and 14%, 75%, 11%. The correlation coefficients for mammography were respectively r = 0.34 (p 0.05) and r = 0.27 (p > 0.05) for both radiologists, for Ultrasound r = 0.24 (p > 0.05) and for MRI r = 0.81 (p 0.01). Conclusion. Of the three imaging modalities contrast enhanced MR has the lowest false negative rate in detecting ILC and has the highest accuracy in measuring the size of the ILC. MR could play a key role in the pre-operative work-up for accurate tumor size determination.

J	BCI:BCI200400340106	15197797			Clonality of lobular carcinoma in situ and synchronous invasive lobular carcinoma		Hwang, E. Shelley (shelley.hwang@ucsfmedctr.org) ; Nyante, Sarah J.; Chen, Yurm Yi; Moore, Dan; DeVries, Sandy; Korkola, James E.; Esserman, Laura J.; Waldman, Frederic M.									Cancer		2004	June 12, 2004	100	12	2562-2572	2562	2572							BACKGROUND. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) of the breast is considered a marker for an increased risk of carcinoma in both breasts. However, the frequent association of LCIS with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) suggests a precursor-product relation. The possible genomic relation between synchronous LCIS and 3 ILC was analyzed using the technique of array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). METHODS. Twenty-four samples from the University of California-San Francisco pathology archives that contained synchronous LCIS and ILC were identified. Array CGH was performed using random primer-amplified microdissected DNA. Samples were hybridized onto bacterial artificial chromosome arrays composed of approximately 2400 clones. Patterns of alterations within synchronous LCIS and 2 ILC were compared. RESULTS. A substantial proportion of the genome was altered in samples of both 3 LCIS and ILC. The most frequent alterations were gain of 1q and loss of 16q, both of which usually occurred as whole-arm changes. Smaller regions of gain and loss 4 were seen on other chromosome arms. Fourteen samples of LCIS were related more to their paired samples of ILC than to any other ILC, as demonstrated by a weighted similarity score. CONCLUSIONS. LCIS and ILC are neoplastic lesions that demonstrate a range of genomic alterations. In the current study, the genetic relation between synchronous LCIS and ILC suggested clonality in a majority of the paired specimens. These data were consistent with a progression pathway from LCIS to ILC. The authors conclude that LCIS, which is known to be a marker for an environment that is permissive of neoplasia, may itself represent a precursor to invasive carcinoma.

J	BCI:BCI200400314038	15160335			Hormone replacement therapy in relation to breast carcinoma incidence rate ratios - A prospective Danish cohort study		Tjonneland, Anne (annet@cancer.dk) ; Christensen, Jane; Thomsen, Birthe L.; Olsen, Anja; Overvad, Kim; Ewertz, Marianne; Mellemkjaer, Lene									Cancer		2004	June 1, 2004	100	11	2328-2337	2328	2337							BACKGROUND. The goal of the current study was to investigate the relation between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and breast carcinoma in a prospective study cohort. Particular attention was paid to the type of HRT used and to the association of HRT type with estrogen receptor status and tumor histology. METHODS. Between 1993 and 1997, a total of 29,875 women were enrolled in the Danish Cancer Society's prospective "Diet, Cancer and Health" study. Among 23,618 women who were assumed to be postmenopausal and for whom information on HRT use was available, we identified 423 cases of breast carcinoma over a median follow-tip period of 4.8 years. Statistical analyses were based on the Cox proportional hazards model, with age serving as the time parameter. RESULTS. The breast carcinoma incidence rate ratio (IRR) was 2.22 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.80-2.75) for users of HRT at baseline compared with women who never received HRT. Among HRT users (relative to nonusers), the IRR for estrogen receptor-positive tumors (2.38; 95% CI, 1.84-3.06) was greater than the IRR for estrogen receptor-negative tumors (1.56; 95% CI, 1.00-2.43). HRT use at baseline also was analyzed in relation to the incidence of lobular carcinoma and the incidence of ductal carcinoma; the adjusted IRR associated with HRT use was 3.53 (95% CI, 1.94-6.41) for lobular carcinoma and 2.10 (95% CI, 1.64-2.70) for ductal carcinoma. The likelihood of developing estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinoma was found to depend significantly on the type of HRT regimen used (P = 0.03), with women receiving continuous therapy having the greatest probability of developing estrogen receptor-positive disease. CONCLUSIONS. An increased breast carcinoma IRR was found to be associated with current HRT use. In addition, relative to other types of HRT regimens, continuous estrogen + progestin regimens were found to be associated with an increased risk of breast carcinoma, and particularly estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinoma.

Shelley									Human Pathology		2004	June 2004	35	6	759-763	759	763							It has been increasingly recognized that ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and invasive cancer of the breast are often closely associated with one another. However, the genomic relationship between these histologically distinct entities has not been well characterized. Refinements in high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) techniques allow for a detailed comparison of genomic alterations in synchronously occurring tumors. following case illustrates how array CGH may be used to better understand whether synchronous neoplasms share a common orgin.

(sigurd.lax@uni-graz.at)									Modern Pathology		2004	May 2004	17	5	597-602	597	602							Local recurrence of bilateral breast carcinomas is rare, but of biological interest, since it is unclear as to which tumor the local recurrence is related to, the ipsilateral or the contralateral, or whether it is an independent neoplasm. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic relationship of bilateral breast carcinomas to each other and to their local recurrences. Eight cases of bilateral breast carcinomas, five with and three without local recurrence were analyzed using a microsatellite assay for 13 microsatellite loci. The presence of loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability in the various tumors was used for clonal analysis. All eight bilateral breast carcinomas showed divergent alterations in at least two microsatellite loci, which ruled out a genetic relationship. Four of five local recurrences were genetically related to the ipsilateral tumor and unrelated to the contralateral tumor. Only one local recurrence that occurred 11.8 years after the surgery of an infiltrative lobular carcinoma simultaneously with distant metastases was genetically related to the contralateral breast carcinoma. Although the number of cases in our study is limited, there is evidence that local recurrence of bilateral breast carcinoma frequently arises from the ipsilateral tumor.

J	BCI:BCI200400272134	15077190			Cytoplasmic localization of p120ctn and E-cadherin loss characterize lobular breast carcinoma from preinvasive to metastatic lesions		Sarrio, David; Perez-Mies, Belen; Hardisson, David; Moreno-Bueno, Gema; Suarez, Asuncion; Cano, Amparo; Martin-Perez, Jorge; Gamallo, Carlos; Palacios, Jose (jpalacios@cnio.es)									Oncogene		2004	April 22, 2004	23	19	3272-3283	3272	3283							Accumulating evidences indicate that p120 catenin, a member of the E-cadherin (E-CD)/catenin adhesion complex, plays a role in tumor invasion. To establish the expression pattern of p120 in breast cancer, we analysed 326 breast tissue biopsies by tissue microarray. Most of the lobular tumors (88%) showed exclusive cytoplasmic localization, and 6% of them also had p120 nuclear staining. Cytoplasmic p120 strongly associated with complete loss of E-CD and beta-catenin not only in lobular carcinoma and its metastases but also in atypical lobular hyperplasias. In the latter, loss of heterozygosity of E-CD gene was also observed. Complete loss of E-CD and cytoplasmic and nuclear p120 staining was also observed in primary lobular cancer cell cultures generated by us. In ductal tumors, by contrast, reduction of p120 and E-CD in membrane was very common (57 and 53%, respectively), whereas cytoplasmic p120 staining was rarely seen. This simultaneous reduction of membranous E-CD and p120 was not associated with increased Src kinase activity. To demonstrate that cytoplasmic p120 localization was a consequence of the absence of E-CD, the endogenous E-CD was re-expressed in MDA-231 cells by 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5Aza) treatment. After treatment, p120 shifted from the cytoplasm to the membrane, where it colocalized with endogenous E-CD. Additionally, suppressing E-CD expression in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells by stable transfection of the transcriptional repressors Snail, E47 or Slug, provokes p120 cytoplasmic localization and p120 isoform switching. In conclusion, abnormal cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of p120, which are mediated by the absence of E-CD, characteristically occur in the early stages of lobular breast cancer and are maintained during tumor progression to metastasis. Consequently, p120 may be an important mediator of the oncogenic effects derived from E-CD inactivation, including enhanced motility and invasion, in lobular breast cancer.

Our results showed that age, stage, treatment and grade significantly influenced outcome regardless of the confounding factors considered, with histology failing to achieve significant independent prognostic information. The survival rates were highest at ages 50-69 years for stage I and at ages 40-49 years for stages II-IV. The rates were lowest at ages ltoreq39 years for stages I-II and at ages gtoreq70 years for stages III-IV. The differences in survival between grade 1 and grade 3 were 9% in stage I and 20% in stage II. The treatment leading to the best survival was surgery plus radiation for stages I-II and surgery combined with chemotherapy for stages III-IV. Lobular carcinoma had a better prognosis than ductal carcinoma; this can be explained by more grade I and less grade 3 cases in lobular carcinoma. The worse prognosis for young patients than other ages can be explained by their higher proportion of poorly differentiated cancers. Stage I patients aged 50-69 years having the best survival is likely due to the earlier diagnosis achieved through screening.														0007-0920		10.1038/sj.bjc.6601662

Ribeiro-Silva, A. (ardsilva@rpa.fmrp.usp.br) ; Ramalho, L. N. Z.; Garcia, S. B.; Zucoloto, S.									Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research		2004	January 2004	37	1	89-95	89	95							Several investigators have identified Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) particles in breast carcinomas, a fact that supports a role for EBV in mammary tamorigenesis. The possible mechanism involved in this process is not clear. The present study was carried out in an attempt to determine whether there is a relationship between latent infection with EBV and p53 and p63 expression in breast carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry developed with 3.3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride was performed in 85 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast carcinomas using anti-EBV EBNA-1, anti-p63, anti-p53, anti-estrogen receptor (ER) and anti-progesterone receptor (PR) antibodies. The cases were selected to represent each of the various histologic types: intraductal carcinoma (N=12), grade I invasive ductal carcinoma (N=15), grade II invasive ductal carcinoma (N=15), grade III invasive ductal carcinoma (N=15), tubular carcinoma (N=8), lobular carcinoma (N=10), and medullary carcinoma (N=10). The ductal breast carcinomas were graded I, II and III based on the Scarff-Bloom and Richardson grading system modified by Elston and Ellis. One slide containing at least 1000 neoplastic cells was examined in each case. ER, PR, p63, p53 and EBNA-1 were positive in 60, 40, 11.8, 21.2 and 37.6% of carcinomas, respectively. There was a correlation between EBNA-1 and p63 expression (P<0.001), but not between EBNA-1 and p53 (P=0.10). These data suggest a possible role for p63 in the mammary tumorigenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection.

Static 99mTc-sestamibi scintimammography (SMM) has been performed in 101 breast tumors (98 patients). SMM were scored from 0 to 4 according to intensity of 99mTc-sestamibi uptake and classified in two groups: SMM with absence or low tumor uptake (0, 1, 2) and SMM with high tumor uptake (3, 4). Tumor histopathological characteristics have been determined on core or excisional biopsy. The 99mTc-sestamibi uptake (low vs. high) correlated to classical prognostic factors: positively with Scarff-Bloom and Richardson (SBR) grade (p < 0.0005), axillary involvement (p < 0.0005), and tumor size (p < 0.0005) and negatively with estrogen receptors (p < 0.001). Fixation of 99mTc-sestamibi in invasive lobular carcinoma was lower than in invasive ductal carcinoma (p < 0.01) despite a similar mean tumor size (28 +/- 14 mm vs. 24 +/- 14 mm). Relations between 99mTc-sestamibi uptake and tumor size, histologic type, and axillary involvement were independent variables also significant in multivariate analysis (p < 0.0005, p < 0.005, p < 0.05, respectively). Moreover, the five-year survival rate was higher when 99mTc-sestamibi breast tumor uptake was low (p < 0.005). This difference is also significant using the Cox model (p < 0.05). Uptake of 99mTc-sestamibi (low vs. high) discriminates breast tumors with different histopathological characteristics and prognosis.														0735-7907		10.1081/CNV-200026388

(gynbreast@mskcc.org)									Gynecologic Oncology		2004	January 2004	92	1	327-330	327	330							Objective: To describe the utility of laparoscopic evaluation of adnexal masses in women with stage IV breast cancer. Methods: A retrospective review of gynecologic and breast surgery databases at our institution was performed to identify patients with stage IV breast cancer who underwent surgical evaluation for an adnexal mass or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) between January 1986 and August 2002. Patient demographics and operative and pathologic findings were reviewed. Results: Thirty-one patients were identified. Median age was 47 years (range, 25-79 years). Pathology of the primary breast tumor was infiltrating ductal carcinoma in 58%, invasive lobular carcinoma in 29%, and unspecified in 13%. Median time from diagnosis of stage IV breast cancer to surgical evaluation of the adnexa was 15 months (range, 0-106 months). Surgery consisted of planned laparotomy in four patients and laparoscopic evaluation in 27 patients. Six patients had laparoscopic BSO for hormonal ablation. The remaining 21 patients had laparoscopic evaluation of an adnexal mass. Conversion to laparotomy occurred in three patients based on intraoperative findings of suspected primary ovarian cancer and for technical reasons in one patient. Overall, metastatic breast cancer was diagnosed in 21 (68%) of 31 patients, including two patients with occult metastases undergoing BSO for hormonal ablation. Primary ovarian cancer was found in 3 (10%) of 31 patients, and 7 (22%) of 31 patients had benign findings. Pathologic intraoperative frozen section was obtained in 21 (84%) of 25 patients undergoing laparoscopic evaluation for an adnexal mass. Intraoperative frozen section was concordant with final pathology in 20 (95%) of 21 patients (18 on laparoscopic evaluation, two on laparotomy). Conclusions: The majority of patients with stage IV breast cancer who present with an adnexal mass will be diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. A small subset of patients will be diagnosed with primary ovarian cancer; thus, the evaluation of an adnexal mass even in this stage IV setting is warranted. Accurate diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer versus ovarian cancer can be made laparoscopically, thereby avoiding laparotomy in the metastatic breast cancer setting.														0090-8258		10.1016/j.ygyno.2003.10.026

Neoplasma (Bratislava)		2004		51	6	481-486	481	486							The purpose of the present study was to evaluate breast carcinoma samples before and two days after treatment with tamoxifen in order to analyse early histopathological alterations - particularly nuclear alterations - as well as immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67, Erb-B2, VEGF, TGf-beta 1 and ILK proteins. Twenty one cases of invasive ductal and lobular breast carcinoma were studied. Patients were submitted to biopsy of the lesion and, after confirmation of the diagnosis, they received 20 mg of tamoxifen a day, beginning two days before surgery. The samples obtained during biopsy and after surgery were stained with HE for histopathological diagnosis. Estrogen receptor was positive in IS cases and negative in 3. The immunohistochemical method was applied for the detection of Ki-67, Erb-B2, protein, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta 1) and integrin linked kinase (ILK). Two days after tamoxifen treatment, the following results were observed: 1) decrease in the cell volume, chomatine condensation, nucleoli less evident and clearly defined nuclear limits; 2) significant reduction in the expression of Erb-B2 protein and significant increase in the expression of TGF-beta 1 protein; 3) expression of others proteins (Ki-67, VEGF and ILK) was not altered during the indicated time frame. Our results suggest that analyzing nuclear alterations and expression of Erb-B2 and TGF-beta 1 proteins would be useful to assess the initial response to tamoxifen.

Results Of seventy-two lesions, CNB identified invasive breast carcinoma in forty-three, atypical ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in three, benign in twenty and nonspecific in six. The principle histology identified at CNB was confirmed at OB for 90% of the lesions, generating a kappa value of 0. 798 (P0. 01). The sensitivity for malignancy with CNB was 92% and the specificity was 100%. The reasons for cancers missed by CNB included clinical sampling error in 2 cases, histological underdiagnosis for 3 cases and inadequate management strategy for 1 case. There were some difficulties with CNB in the diagnosis of DCIS, early invasive ductal carcinoma and infiltrative lobular carcinoma. Conclusions Ultrasound-guided coreneedle breast biopsy is a sensitive, as well as a high specific diagnostic method, except for a few special kinds of breast diseases.														1002-0101																				
J	BCI:BCI200400021744	14601057			DNA methylation of RASSF1A, HIN-1, RAR-beta, Cyclin D2 and Twist in in situ and invasive lobular breast carcinoma.		Fackler, Mary Jo; McVeigh, Megan; Evron, Ella; Garrett, Elizabeth; Mehrotra, Jyoti; Polyak, Kornelia; Sukumar, Saraswati; Argani, Pedram (pargani@jhmi.edu)									International Journal of Cancer		2003	20 December, 2003	107	6	970-975	970	975							Little is known about epigenetic silencing of genes by promoter hypermethylation in lobular breast cancers. The promoter methylation status of 5 cancer-related genes (RASSF1A, HIN-1, RAR-beta, Cyclin D2 and Twist) was evaluated in 2 types of lobular cancers, in situ (LCIS) and invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC) (n=32), and compared to ductal in situ (DCIS) and invasive (IDC) breast cancers (n=71). By using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), 100% of ILC and 69% of LCIS cases were found to have 1 or more hypermethylated genes among the panel of 5 genes (compared to 100% IDC and 95% of DCIS). Two or more hypermethylated genes were detected per tumor in 79% of invasive and 61% of in situ lobular carcinomas compared to 81% of IDC and 77% of DCIS. By contrast, DNA from nearly all normal reduction mammoplasty tissues (n=8) was unmethylated for the 5 genes. The methylation profiles of lobular vs. ductal carcinomas with respect to RASSF1A, Cyclin D2, RARbeta, and Hin-1 genes were similar, suggesting that gene silencing by promoter hypermethylation is likely to be important in both groups of diseases. Distinctly different, Twist was hypermethylated less often in ILC (16%, 3/19 cases) than in IDC (56%, 15/27 cases) (p=0.01). These results suggest that these 2 types of tumors share many common methylation patterns and some molecular differences. Additional studies might lend further understanding into the etiology and clinical behavior of this tumor type.														0020-7136		10.1002/ijc.11508

International Journal of Cancer		2003	20 November, 2003	107	4	647-651	647	651							Use of combined estrogen-progestin hormone replacement therapy appears to be associated with an increased risk of invasive lobular breast carcinomas (ILC) and, to a lesser degree, with risk of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Conceivably, ILCs are more hormonally responsive and so may be more strongly associated than IDCs with reproductive and anthropometric characteristics that can influence hormone levels. However, few epidemiologic studies of breast cancer have evaluated these factors by histologic type. We conducted a population-based case-control study of women aged 65-79 years in western Washington State. Responses from 975 women diagnosed with breast cancer during 1997-1999 were compared to those of 1,007 controls. Associations between various reproductive and anthropometric factors and risks of IDC (n = 656) and ILC (n = 196) were evaluated using polytomous logistic regression. Earlier age at men-arche, later age at menopause and obesity were more strongly associated with elevated risks of IDC than ILC. Alternatively, oral contraceptive use was associated with an increased risk of ILC but not IDC. Thus, the pattern of results that we observed suggest that factors influencing endogenous hormones and duration of ovarian function may be more strongly associated with IDC risk, while exogenous hormones may be more strongly associated with ILC risk.														0020-7136		10.1002/ijc.11465

The purpose of the present paper is to report a case of oral metastasis of breast carcinoma diagnosed by FNAC. CASE: A 45-year-old, black woman was referred for evaluation of symptomatic swelling in the left mandible. The medical history revealed that the patient had undergone extensive surgery to remove a lobular carcinoma. She had finished chemotherapy treatment about 5 months earlier. Due to the main diagnostic considerations of metastatic and inflammatory disease, FNAC FNAC was performed. The cytologic picture was consistent with a metastatic glandular neoplasm. CONCLUSION: FNAC is a safe, reliable, cost-effective and easy procedure and sometimes eliminates the need for open biopsy.

Cancer Research		2003	November 1, 2003	63	21	7167-7175	7167	7175							Invasive lobular and ductal breast tumors have distinct histologies and clinical presentation. Other than altered expression of E-cadherin, little is known about the underlying biology that distinguishes the tumor subtypes. We used cDNA microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed between lobular and ductal tumors. Unsupervised clustering of tumors failed to distinguish between the two subtypes. Prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM) was able to predict tumor type with an accuracy of 93.7%. Genes that were significantly differentially expressed between the two groups were identified by MaxT permutation analysis using t tests (20 cDNA clones and 10 unique genes), significance analysis for microarrays (33 cDNA clones and 15 genes, at an estimated false discovery rate of 2%), and PAM (31 cDNAs and 15 genes). There were 8 genes identified by all three of these related methods (E-cadherin, survivin, cathepsin B, TP11, SPRY1, SCYA14, TFAP2B, and thrombospondin 4), and an additional 3 that were identified by significance analysis for microarrays and PAM (osteopontin, HLA-G, and CHC1). To validate the differential expression of these genes, 7 of them were tested by real-time quantitative PCR, which verified that they were differentially expressed in lobular versus ductal tumors. In conclusion, specific changes in gene expression distinguish lobular from ductal breast carcinomas. These genes may be important in understanding the basis of phenotypic differences among breast cancers.

J	BCI:BCI200300510971	14557212			Risk of mortality by histologic type of breast cancer among women aged 50 to 79 years.		Li, Christopher I. (cili@fhcrc.org) ; Moe, Roger E.; Daling, Janet R.									Archives of Internal Medicine		2003	October 13, 2003	163	18	2149-2153	2149	2153							Background: Recent studies suggest that the use of combined estrogen and progestin hormone replacement therapy is associated with an increased risk of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), but that it has little association with risk of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Also, the incidence rates of ILC have risen over the past 10 years while those of IDC have remained constant. Differences in survival rates by histologic types of tumor have been reported, but few of the published studies were population based or had adequate power to address this issue. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study spanning the years 1974 through 1998 using data from the 9 cancer registries that have participated in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program since 1974. The cohort consisted of 164958 women aged 50 to 79 years who had been diagnosed as having 1 of 7 histologic types of invasive breast cancer. Risks of mortality due to any cause were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Women with ILC had a risk of mortality 11% lower than women with IDC. The magnitude of this difference has increased over the past 10 years and, from 1994 through 1998, the risk of mortality was 26% lower for women with ILC. Also, the risk of mortality was between 8% and 34% lower in women with mucinous carcinoma, comedocarcinoma, or medullary, tubular, and papillary carcinomas compared with women with IDC. Conclusions: Differences in prognosis by histologic type of breast cancer were identified. The survival rate of women 50 to 79 years old who have ILC, the cancer whose histologic type is the most closely linked with the use of combined estrogen and progestin hormone replacement therapy, is more favorable than that of women with IDC and appears to be improving over time.														0003-9926		10.1001/archinte.163.18.2149

Robert									International Journal of Cancer		2003	10 October, 2003	106	6	961-964	961	964							We examined the association between oral contraceptive use and risk of specific breast cancer histopathologies in a large, multi-center, population-based, case-control study. Women younger than age 75 with a new diagnosis of invasive breast cancer were identified from 4 statewide tumor registries. We compared women with lobular (n=493) and ductal carcinoma (n=5,510) to randomly selected controls (n=9,311). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each histologic type were estimated using polytomous logistic regression, adjusted for other breast cancer risk factors. Current oral contraceptive use was associated with increased risk of lobular carcinoma (OR=2.6, 95% CI=1.0-7.1) and there was a significant trend (p=0.017) of increased risk with more recent use. Oral contraceptive use was not clearly associated with ductal carcinoma (OR=1.2, 95% CI=0.8-1.9). These results suggest that the association between oral contraceptive use and risk of breast cancer may vary by histologic type.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to investigate the methylation status of the ER beta gene in the ER beta negative breast cancer cell lines SkBr3 and MDA-MB-435. A gradual reduction in, but not a complete loss of, ER beta expression was observed during the transition from normal and pre-invasive lesions to invasive cancers, where ER beta was lost in 21% of cases. This was more pronounced in invasive ductal than in lobular carcinomas, a significantly higher proportion of which were ER beta-positive (74% compared with 91%, respectively, p=0.0004). Examination of paired primary cancers with their axillary lymph node metastases showed that if ER beta was present in the primary tumour, it persisted in the metastasis. Treatment of ER beta-negative cell lines with DNA methyl transferase inhibitors restored ER beta expression, providing experimental evidence that silencing of ER beta in breast carcinomas could be due to promoter hypermethylation. These results suggest that loss of ER beta expression is one of the hallmarks of breast carcinogenesis and that it may be a reversible process involving methylation.														0022-3417		10.1002/path.1436

Prostaglandins Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids		2003	October 2003	69	4	275-281	275	281							Lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenase are key mediators of arachidonic acid metabolism. The eicosanoids metabolites from these oxygynases have been shown to regulate the growth and death of cancer cells. This study determined the level of expression of 5-, 12-, 15-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in a cohort of breast cancer patients and their correlation with clinical outcomes. Compared with normal breast tissues, tumour tissues exhibited a significantly higher levels of 12-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase-2 (P<0.05), and significantly lower level of 15-lipoxygenase (P=0.05). Lobular carcinomas had a higher level of cyclooxygenase-2 and lower level of 15-lipoxygenase than ductal carcinomas. The lowest level of 15-lipoxygenase was seen in TNM3 and TNM4 tumours and from patients who died of breast cancer. Levels of 12- and 5-lipoxygenases were also particularly high in tumours from patients who died of breast cancer. This study shows that human breast tumours aberrantly express lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenase-2 and that decreased level of 15-lipoxygenase and raised level of cyclooxygenase-2 and 12-lipoxygenase has prognostic value in patients with breast cancer.

British Journal of Cancer		2003	15 September, 2003	89	6	1035-1041	1035	1041							Patients undergoing primary chemotherapy for invasive breast cancer consented to a core biopsy of the invasive breast primary pre- and 24 h postchemotherapy. The resulting tissue was analysed for apoptosis, Ki67, ER and HER-2 using immunohistochemical techniques. These data were then used to evaluate the relationship between these biological markers and response to chemotherapy and overall survival. Response rate to chemotherapy in this group was 86%, 16 patients (25%) achieved a clinical complete response and 41 (63%) a partial response. Prechemotherapy there was a significant correlation between Ki67 and apoptotic index (AI), r=0.6, (P<0.001). A significant rise in AI (P<0.001), and fall in Ki67 (P=0.002) was seen 24 h following chemotherapy. No relationship was seen between pretreatment AI and clinical response, but higher Ki67 and growth index (Ki67/AI ratio, GI) did correlate with clinical response (both r=0.31, P<0.025). No correlation was seen between the change in AI or Ki67 at 24 h and clinical response or survival. Significant changes in apoptosis and proliferation can be demonstrated 24 h following chemotherapy, but these changes do not relate to clinical response or outcome in this study. Pretreatment proliferation and GI are however predictive of response to chemotherapy in breast cancer.														0007-0920		10.1038/sj.bjc.6601173

We investigated if this trend was also present in Geneva, Switzerland, where breast cancer incidence is one of the highest in Europe. We analyzed trends in breast cancer incidence according to histologic subtype, age and stage, to clarify the pattern. Our population-based study includes all histologically confirmed invasive breast carcinomas (n = 6,247) recorded between 1976 and 1999 at the Geneva Cancer Registry. Breast histology was classified as ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma and other. Incidence trends were studied by log-linear regression analyses. Models including effects of age, period and birth cohorts were used to describe rising incidence trends. The incidence of ductal carcinoma increased 1.2% per year (ptrend < 0.001) from 85.2 to 110.1/100,000. This increase concerned women aged 50-69 years and early-stage tumors. Lobular cancer incidence increased disproportionately (14.4% per year, ptrend < 0.01) and rose from 2.9 to 20.5/100,000. This increase affected all age categories and both localized and advanced stages. In addition, a strong age-cohort effect was present (p < 0.05), and women aged 50-59 years born after 1944 experienced the most marked increase. Our study shows a disproportionate increase of lobular breast cancer incidence compared to ductal cancer incidence. Contrary to ductal cancer, trends for lobular cancer are unlikely to be explained by increased use of screening mammography. Other explanations must be researched, in particular the role played by hormone replacement therapy.														0020-7136		10.1002/ijc.11032

Two types of EC-BC structure alterations were found: homogeneity disorder accompanied by appearance of local thickening and gaps or complete lack of these structures. Alterations of type 1 were found in all the analyzed samples of ductal and combined carcinomas and partially in lobular carcinomas, in in situ structures and in invasion components as well. Alterations of type 2 were found in 16 cases of lobular carcinomas of 23 examined. Our data suggest the existence of two groups of lobular BC: carcinomas with partial depletion of EC-BC structures and carcinomas which lost these structures. Further investigations are needed to evaluate clinical importance of the difference found.														0004-1955

JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association)		2003	March 19, 2003	289	11	1421-1424	1421	1424							Context Research has suggested that use of combined estrogen and progestin hormone replacement therapy (CHRT) increases breast cancer risk and that CHRT use is more strongly associated with the risk of invasive lobular breast carcinoma than that of invasive ductal carcinoma. Lobular carcinoma is less common than ductal carcinoma but can be more difficult to diagnose because of its subtle elusive infiltrative pattern. Objective To evaluate trends in invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma incidence rates from 1987 through 1999, during which time use of CHRT increased in the United States. Design Descriptive epidemiologic study. Setting Nine cancer registries that participate in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute and that cover Atlanta, Ga; Detroit, Mich; San Francisco-Oakland, Calif; Seattle, Wash; and Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, and Utah. Population Women 30 years of age and older residing in the areas covered by the 9 SEER registries. Main Outcome Measures Proportional changes in incidence rates of invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma among women with no prior history of breast cancer. Results A total of 190458 women were included in this analysis who were identified through the registries as having invasive breast cancer; 7682 of the 198140 potentially eligible women (ie, those identified as not having in situ breast cancer) were excluded from this analysis because stage of cancer was unknown. Invasive breast cancer incidence rates adjusted for age and for SEER historic stage increased 1.04-fold (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.004-1.07) from 1987-1999 (206.7/100 000 to 214.1/100 000, age-adjusted). However, incidence rates of tumors classified as lobular increased 1.52-fold (95% Cl, 1.42-1.63), and those classified as mixed ductal-lobular increased 1.96-fold (95% Cl, 1.80-2.14); rates of these types combined increased 1.65-fold (95% Cl, 1.55-1.78) (19.8/100 000 to 33.4/100 000, age-adjusted). In contrast, ductal carcinoma rates remained largely constant (153.8/100 000 to 155.3/100 000, age-adjusted; proportional change, 1.03 (95% CI, 0.99-1.06)). The proportion of breast cancers with a lobular component increased from 9.5% in 1987 to 15.6% in 1999. Conclusions Ductal carcinoma incidence rates remained essentially constant from 1987-1999 while lobular carcinoma rates increased steadily. This increase presents a clinical challenge given that lobular carcinoma is more difficult to detect than ductal carcinoma by both physical examination and mammography.														0098-7484		10.1001/jama.289.11.1421

Detailed cytomorphologic analysis of the smears was carried out on hematoxylin and eosin-and May-Grunwald-Giemsa-stained slides, and a comparison of results was done. The various cytologic features were also graded semi-quantitatively with the numerical score; logistic regression analysis was done. RESULTS: There were 25 cases of ILC, 30 of IDC, and 10 borderline and 18 benign lesions. Cytologic diagnosis of malignancy on FNAC smears of ILC was offered in 19 cases; of them, 2 cases were diagnosed as ILC. The remaining six cases were diagnosed as borderline (four) and benign lesions (two). Overall sensitivity in detection of malignancy in ILC cases was 76%. FNAC smears of ILC showed moderate (52%) to abundant (32%) cellularity. The cells of ILC were arranged both in clusters and in dissociation (72%). Individual cells were monomorphic (40%) to mildly pleomorphic (60%), and the cells were smaller. The cells showed a smooth, regular nuclear margin; bland chromatin; and indistinct nucleoli. Indian file arrangement was frequently observed (28%). Nuclear molding (28%) and intranuclear inclusions (16%) were also noted. Intracytoplasmic lumina were seen in occasional cases. Logistic regression analysis was carried out, and a comparison between lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma, and borderline and benign lesions was done. Logistic regression analysis of cytomorphologic features showed that cellularity and nuclear margin irregularities were the two most important features to distinguish ILC from IDC. In comparison to borderline lesions, cell dissociation was more common in ILC. The salient cytologic features that helped to distinguish ILC from benign lesions was cell size, cellularity, cell uniformity and chromatin pattern. CONCLUSION: There are overlapping cytologic features between ILC, IDC and borderline breast lesions on FNAC smears.

Crisi, Giovanna Maria; Mandavilli, Srinivas; Cronin, Edward; Ricci, Andrew, Jr. (aricci@harthosp.org)									American Journal of Surgical Pathology		2003	March 2003	27	3	325-333	325	333							Lobular neoplasia (LN), including atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) and lobular carcinoma in situ, may be encountered in breast core biopsies performed for mammographic abnormalities even though LN is often not, in itself, responsible for the abnormal mammogram. The need for surgical excision following a diagnosis of LN on core biopsy is not well defined. We examined pathologic and mammographic findings in a consecutive series of cases diagnosed as LN to address this issue. Radiology/pathology records were reviewed for cases with a pathology diagnosis of pure LN during the period 1998-2001. Specifically excluded were cases with associated atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive mammary carcinoma, or any history of breast malignancy. Thirty-five women 39-76 years of age (mean 52 years) were identified. Specimens were obtained as stereotactic core (31) or limited wire-guided biopsy (four). The diagnoses were lobular carcinoma in situ (12), lobular carcinoma in situ/ALH (10), and ALH (13). Fourteen patients did not undergo excisional biopsy and had no subsequent clinical follow-up to warrant additional biopsy (follow-up 6 months to 3 years). Five patients had no immediate excision, but eventually during clinical follow-up for LN (1 month to 3 years), two developed mammographic lesions in the ipsilateral (one patient) or contralateral breast (one patient) that led to diagnoses of invasive mammary carcinoma (lobular and composite ductal-lobular types, 10 and 8 mm, respectively); three patients had subsequent mammographic findings in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast leading to biopsies showing only LN (two patients) or no neoplastic pathology (one patient). The remaining 16 patients (all core biopsied) underwent immediate wire-guided excisions. Thirteen (81%) showed additional foci of LN, one (6.3%) with atypical ductal hyperplasia, and two (12.5%) with invasive lobular carcinoma (3 mm and <1 mm). Three (19%) had no residual disease; however, additional clinical follow-up in one of these patients revealed an invasive mammary carcinoma in the contralateral breast (false-negative mammography). Radiographic findings were calcifications and density/mass lesions in 27 and 8 cases, respectively. Of 27 cases presenting with Ca2+, 10 showed colocalization of LN and Ca2+. In the eight cases presenting with density/mass, incidental microscopic microcalcifications colocalized to LN were found in two cases. When present, histologic Ca2+ was associated with LN in 12 of 29 cases studied (41%). Of the 21 patients with immediate or subsequent excision, five (24%) were found to have an associated invasive mammary carcinoma (two on immediate excision and three after short-term follow-up of up to 3 years). The bilaterality of cancer risk was expected; however, the number of invasive carcinomas was not. That the invasive carcinomas detected at follow-up were small implies that they might have been present (but occult) at initial presentation. We conclude that lobular carcinoma in situ detected on core biopsy is potentially a significant marker for concurrent and near-term breast pathology requiring complete intensive multidisciplinary clinical follow-up with specific individualization of patient care.														0147-5185		10.1097/00000478-200303000-00005																		
J	BCI:BCI200300222043	12610102			p21WAF1 expression in invasive breast cancer and its association with p53, AP-2, cell proliferation, and prognosis.		Pellikainen, M. J.; Pekola, T. T.; Ropponen, K. M.; Kataja, V. V.; Kellokoski, J. K.; Eskelinen, M. J.; Kosma, V.-M. (VeliMatti.Kosma@ta.fi)									Journal of Clinical Pathology (London)		2003	March 2003	56	3	214-220	214	220							Aims: To evaluate the expression and prognostic relevance of p21WAF1 in breast cancer and to investigate its association with p53, activator protein 2 (AP-2), and cell proliferation (as assessed by Ki-67 expression). Methods: p21WAF1 expression was analysed immunohistochemically in a large prospective, consecutive series of 420 patients with breast cancer diagnosed and treated between 1990 and 1995 at Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland. Inter-relations between p21WAF1 expression and p53, AP-2, and Ki-67 were evaluated. The expression of p21WAF1 was also compared with clinicopathological parameters and the patients' survival. Results: In general, nuclear p21WAF1 expression was low in carcinomas (median, 2.5%; range, 0-70%). Expression was lowest in lobular carcinomas (chi2=7.4; p=0.025). p21WAF1 positive tumours were more often p53 positive (chi2=.4.2; p=0.041) but expression of p21WAF1 did not correlate with AP-2 expression or Ki-67 in the whole patient group. In addition, the combined expression of p21 and p53 was not associated with AP-2 expression. High nuclear p21WAF1 positivity (n=160; 38%) was associated with poor differentiation (chi2=8.1; p=0.017). In the univariate analyses, p21WAF1 expression had no prognostic value for predicting breast cancer related survival (BCRS) or recurrence free survival (RFS) in the whole patient group or in the subgroups investigated. However, in postmenopausal patients with lymph node metastases, and oestrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive tumours, high p21WAF1 expression predicted response to adjuvant hormonal treatment with antioestrogens. In the univariate analysis, the significant factors for predicting BCRS were Ki-67 expression, stage, lymph node status, histological grade, ER and PR status, and those for RFS were Ki-67 expression, stage, and lymph node status. In the multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of shorter BCRS were high cell proliferation activity measured by Ki-67 expression (p<0.001), advanced stage (p<0.001), and poor differentiation (p=0.048). Shorter RFS was independently predicted by high cell proliferative activity (p<0.001) and advanced stage (p<0.001). Conclusions: The regulation of p21WAF1 seems to occur independently of p53 or AP-2 and analysing p21WAF1 expression provided no prognostic information for patients with breast cancer.														0021-9746		10.1136/jcp.56.3.214

Breast		2003	February 2003	12	1	17-22	17	22							The aim of our study was a direct comparison of the ability of positron-emission tomography with FDG-PET and of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine whether breast lesions were benign or malignant and of the two imaging methods capability of depicting eventual multifocal disease. We performed both PET and MRI in 36 patients (40 lesions) who were scheduled for surgery because of suggestive mammographic, sonographic and/or clinical findings. A final histological classification was available for all lesions. Tumour size ranged from 5 to 45 mm (mean 16.7 mm). Sensitivity for lesions, sensitivity for patients, specificity for lesions and specificity for patients were 68.0%, 76.2%, 73.3%, and 73.3% for PET and 92.0%, 95.2%, 73.3%, and 73.3% for MRI, respectively. MRI was more sensitive than FDG-PET in disclosing malignant breast tumours and was also more accurate than FDG-PET in the assessment of multifocal disease. The lower sensitivity of FDG-PET than of MRI seems to be due to difficulties in reliable imaging of carcinomas smaller than 10 mm and of lobular carcinomas.														0960-9776		10.1016/S0960-9776(02)00262-X

Breast		2003	February 2003	12	1	23-35	23	35							The management and outcome of 131 women with infiltrating lobular carcinoma treated in the Belfast City Hospital between October 1987 and February 1999 were reviewed. Two patients had primary hormonal treatment and were excluded from the statistical analysis, and 129 patients were followed up. Fifty-four patients (41%) had initial breast conservation surgery, which was followed by re-excision of margins in eight patients (14.8%) and completion total mastectomy in 26 patients (48.1%). The breast conservation surgery group, 28 patients (21.7%), was compared with the total mastectomy group, 101 patients (78.2%), after a median follow-up period of 90 months (range 24-160 months). The overall survival was 68.7%. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression which showed that lymph node involvement and tumour grade were the only variables affecting survival (P < 0.0001, and 0.01, respectively). The type of surgery performed did not affect survival (P = 0.42). The total number of patients who developed local recurrence was 17 patients (13.1%, 12 patients in the breast conservation surgery group and five patients in the total mastectomy group, P < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis of local recurrence showed that the type of surgery (P < 0.0001), patient age (P = 0.02), tumour grade (P = 0.002), adjuvant radiotherapy (P = 0.013), chemotherapy (P = 0.031) and hormonal treatment (P = 0.003) significantly affected local recurrence. Cox regression analysis showed that the only factor significantly affecting local recurrence was the type of surgery performed (P = 0.02). Patients who underwent mastectomy had less local recurrence than those who had breast conservation surgery. Local recurrence after breast conservation surgery is high, even with clear surgical margins and post-operative radiotherapy. The authors believe that total mastectomy for infiltrating lobular carcinoma is a safer option to control local disease, especially in younger patients and those with high-grade tumours. Overall survival is not affected by the type of surgical treatment. Local recurrence can be a late event and a long-term follow-up is recommended.														0960-9776		10.1016/S0960-9776(02)00182-0

Since their activity has been found to be changed in tumor tissue and/or body fluids of cancer patients, the determination of the peptidase/inhibitor levels is considered as a procedure of diagnostic value. Determination of cathepsin B, its precursor and inhibitor activity in homogenates of tumors and control breast tissue samples of patients with invasive ductal and lobular breast carcinoma and with benign breast disease (BBD) was performed using fluorometric assay. Immunohistochemical staining of the breast tissue samples was carried out using polyclonal antibody against cysteine peptidase inhibitor isolated from human placenta. Procathepsin B and cathepsin B were found to be significantly increased and their endogenous inhibitors decreased in homogenates of tumors from patients with breast cancer. A correlation between procathepsin B or cathepsin B activities as well as cysteine peptidase inhibitor activity and the histopathological grading of the tumor was observed. All samples of the tumor tissue showed positive immunostaining with antibody raised against cysteine peptidase inhibitor, while in the control tissue samples the immunostaining was much weaker. Significant difference observed between the activities of cathepsin B and/or its precursor in malignant and benign tumors might serve as a useful clinical indicator in discrimination between benign and invasive tumors.														0239-8508

Medical Oncology (Totowa)		2003		20	3	221-231	221	231							The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate biological markers, their correlation with response and outcome, and the change in these markers under the influence of preoperative chemotherapy (PCT) in patients with a large primary breast cancer. One hundred and thirty-five women were treated with PCT, followed by locoregional therapy and adjuvant treatment. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), HER-2, p53, and cathepsin D were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) before and after PCT. The overall response (OR) was 70% and the pathologic complete response (pCR) was 13%. Forty-four percent of the patients could be offered breast-conserving surgery (BCS). At a median follow-up of 50 mo the overall survival is 82% and the disease-free survival is 70%. No local recurrence (LR) has developed following BCS. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was more frequently ER-negative and HER-2-positive than invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). P53-negative and ER-negative patients seemed to be more chemosensitive compared to p53-positive patients (74% vs 53%) and ER-positive patients (75% vs 65%). but this difference did not reach statistical significance. A trend toward higher complete pathologic remission rate was seen for ER-negative patients (p = 0.0609). PgR, HER-2, and cathepsin D were not related to response. The pattern of biological markers did not change with PCT. making repeated determination useless.														1357-0560		10.1385/MO:20:3:221

G.; Cuny, Marguerite; Orsetti, Beatrice; Rodriguez, Carmen; Valles, Helene; Bartram, Claus R.; Schuuring, Ed; Theillet, Charles (theillet@valdorel.fnclcc.fr)									International Journal of Cancer		2002	20 December, 2002	102	6	608-614	608	614							Rearrangements of chromosome 11q13 are frequently observed in human cancer. The 11q13 region harbors several chromosomal breakpoint clusters found in hematologic malignancies and exhibits frequent DNA amplification in carcinomas. DNA amplification patterns in breast tumors are consistent with the existence of at least 4 individual amplification units, suggesting the activation of more than 1 gene in this region. Two candidate oncogenes have been identified, CCND1 and EMS1/CORTACTIN, representing centrally localized amplification units. Genes involved in the proximal and distal amplicons remain to be identified. Recently we reported on a putative transforming gene, MYEOV, mapping 360 kb centromeric to CCND1. This gene was found to be rearranged and activated concomitantly with CCND1 in a subset of t(11;14)(q13;q32)-positive multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines. To evaluate the role of the MYEOV gene in the proximal amplification core, we tested 946 breast tumors for copy number increase of MYEOV relative to neighboring genes or markers. RNA expression levels were studied in a subset of 72 tumors for which both RNA and DNA were available. Data presented here show that the MYEOV gene is amplified in 9.5% (90/946) and abnormally expressed in 16.6% (12/72) of breast tumors. Amplification patterns showed that MYEOV was most frequently coamplified with CCND1 (74/90), although independent amplification of MYEOV could also be detected (16/90). Abnormal expression levels correlated only partially with DNA amplification. MYEOV DNA amplification correlated with estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive cancer, invasive lobular carcinoma type and axillary nodal involvement. In contrast to CCND1 amplification, no association with disease outcome could be found. Our data suggest that MYEOV is a candidate oncogene activated in the amplification core located proximal to CCND1.

The incidence of invasive lobular carcinoma has been increasing among postmenopausal women in some parts of the United States. Part of this may be due to changes in classification over time. However, the use of combined (estrogen and progestin) hormone replacement therapy (CHRT) also has increased during the last decade and may account in part for the increase in invasive lobular breast carcinoma. METHODS. A large, multicenter case-control study of Caucasian and African-American women who were diagnosed at age < 65 years with their first invasive breast tumor from July 1, 1994 through April 30, 1998 was conducted. In-person interviews were conducted with 1749 postmenopausal patients, and their responses were compared with the responses of 1953 postmenopausal control women identified through random-digit dialing who met the study criteria of being postmenopausal at the time of diagnosis. Polytomous logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) as an estimate of the relative risk and to compute the 95% confidence interval (95%CI) associated with the use of various regimens of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) among women diagnosed with ductal breast carcinoma, lobular (or mixed lobular and ductal) breast carcinoma, and a grouping of other histologic types of breast carcinoma. RESULTS. Ever use of unopposed estrogen therapy (ERT) was not associated with an increase in the risk of any histologic type of breast carcinoma. The risk of invasive lobular breast carcinoma and the risk of breast carcinoma of the grouping of other histologies increased among women currently using CHRT (OR, 2.2; 95%CI, 1.4-3.3; and OR, 1.9; 95%CI, 1.0-3.4, respectively). The risk increase was greater for the mixed lobular-ductal type than for the pure lobular type of breast carcinoma, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was some indication that gtoreq 5 years of continuous CHRT (gtoreq 25 days per month of progestin) was associated with a higher risk of lobular breast carcinoma (OR, 2.5; 95%CI, 1.4-4.3) compared with sequential CHRT (< 25 days per month of progestin; OR, 1.5; 95%CI, 0.8-2.6). Current use of continuous CHRT was only moderately associated with risk of ductal breast carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS. Postmenopausal women who take CHRT appear to be at an increased risk of lobular breast carcinoma. Data from this study suggest that neither ERT use nor CHRT substantially increase the risk of ductal breast carcinoma among women age < 65 years.

J	BCI:BCI200300027132	12402149			Infiltrating ductal and lobular breast carcinomas are characterised by different interrelationships among markers related to angiogenesis and hormone dependence.		Coradini, D. (coradini@istitutotumori.mi.it) ; Pellizzaro, C.; Veneroni, S.; Ventura, L.; Daidone, M. G.									British Journal of Cancer		2002	4 November 2002	87	10	1105-1111	1105	1111							To obtain a more integrated understanding of the different breast cancer phenotypes and to investigate whether bio-molecular profiles can distinguish between specific histotypes, we explored the interrelations among several biologic variables indicative of, or related to, hormone dependence, proliferation and apoptosis control, and angiogenesis in ductal and lobular carcinomas, the most common histotypes. Oestrogen and progesterone receptors, tumour proliferative activity, the expression of cyclin A, p16ink4A, p27kip1, p21waf1, p53, bcl-2, and levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) were evaluated in 190 in ductal and 67 lobular carcinomas. Our findings support the hypothesis that in ductal and lobular carcinomas are two distinct, partially phenotypically unrelated entities, the latter being characterised by the presence of features indicative of differentiation such as oestrogen receptors, low proliferation and lack of p53 expression and associated with low vascular endothelial growth factor content compared to angiogenesis in ductal carcinomas. Conversely, no significant difference was found between lobular carcinomas and in ductal carcinomas considering the frequency distribution of PgR-positive cases, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors acting at the G1/S boundary, bcl-2 and HIF-1alpha protein expression. Although both generally defined as hormone responsive, in ductal and lobular carcinomas are also characterised by biologic patterns in which proteins related to hormone responsiveness, cell-cycle control, apoptosis and angiogenesis were differently associated. This finding suggests the need to refine breast cancer characterisation in order to provide detailed information about individual tumours, or subsets of tumours, that will help in defining optimal treatment approaches.

J	BCI:BCI200300135623	12508491			Considerations in breast imaging diagnosis.		Endo, Tokiko									Nippon Acta Radiologica		2002	November 2002	62	13	729-733	729	733							Certain points regarding breast imaging diagnosis are open to interpretation and are considered difficult to understand in the short course on mammography. For example, focal asymmetric density (FAD) may or may not include mass lesions. To assess whether FAD includes mass lesions or not, a comparison of density with equal gland volume, margins, and internal structure is important. Calcifications must be read carefully according to shape and distribution. The shapes of calcifications can be used to estimate the intra-ductal structure of breast cancer, but small round calcifications and amorphous calcifications can be interpreted as both benign and malignant lesions. Therefore, distribution brings important information to the assessment. Architectural distortion can be caused by fibrosis in both benign and malignant lesions. Lobular carcinoma and scirrhous carcinoma are the most common malignant diseases, but radial scar, inflammatory disease, and surgical scar need to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Finally, the pathological assessment of breast cancer and mammographic technology are basic, important factors in reading mammography.														0048-0428

Ultrastructural Pathology		2002	November-December 2002	26	6	411-414	411	414							Breast hypoplasia is encountered as part of genetic syndromes or as a result of iatrogenic factors. The incidence of this malformation and the occurrence of breast carcinoma in such cases are unknown. The authors present a 66-year-old patient with a severe breast hypoplasia and invasive lobular carcinoma. The advanced clinical stage required neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After 5 CMF cycles with no significant effect, a modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection was performed. The pathological report revealed an infiltrating lobular carcinoma with combined classical and alveolar growth and with minor morphological changes after the chemotherapy. Immunostaining for cell proliferation markers, apoptotic regulators, and cell adhesion molecules, such as the CD44 family and members of the cadherin-catenin group, was performed. The tumor expressed a high bcl-2/low bax ratio and lacked p53 immunoreactivity, which could explain the resistance to neoajuvant therapy. The lack of adhesion molecules, except for strong E-cadherin and beta-catenin reactivity, and weak CD44v6 expression were demonstrated. To the authors' knowledge this is the first case of an invasive lobular carcinoma in a hypoplastic breast reported in the English literature.														0191-3123

To further evaluate the role of FH in tumorigenesis, we screened FH mutations from tumor types seen in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer mutation carriers-41 uterine and 10 cutaneous leiomyomas, 52 renal cell carcinomas, 53 sarcomas, 29 prostate carcinomas, and 15 lobular breast carcinomas. Few mutations were detected. Biallelic inactivation of FH was found in one uterine leiomyosarcoma, one cutaneous leiomyoma, and one soft tissue sarcoma. Whereas the two former lesions were shown to originate from a germ-line mutation, the soft tissue sarcoma is to our knowledge the first example of purely somatic inactivation of FH in tumors.

A bright field alternative permitting direct visualization of gene amplification using conventional microscopy may be more readily incorporated into routine diagnostic pathology practice. Interobserver reproducibility represents an important component of the validation of such an assay. We tested the hypothesis that a first-generation bright field alternative to fluorescence in situ hybridization, a Nanogold (Nanoprobes, Inc, Yaphank, NY, USA) (or gold-label)/autometallographic assay for HER-2/neu gene amplification in breast carcinoma, can be reproducibly interpreted by pathologists. Reference standard was direct fluorescence in situ hybridization supplemented by RNA/RNA in situ hybridization. Reproducibility of selected conventional histologic parameters was captured based on a hematoxylin and eosin slide accompanying the GOLDFISH preparation (gold-facilitated autometallographic in situ hybridization) as an indication of comparative reproducibility. The average kappa among GOLDFISH observers was 0.84, which was at least or concordant of observers scoring nuclear grade (kappa=0.50) and the presence of in situ carcinoma (kappa=0.57) by conventional histopathology. The GOLDFISH assay was specifically designed for qualitative interpretation, thus obviating the need for oil immersion microscopy and signal enumeration, and its interpretation was highly reproducible among five pathologists.														0147-5185		10.1097/00000478-200207000-00009

The objective of the present study was to investigate the cytological features of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), regarding which little data is available to date. Cytological features of FNAC of the breast from 21 patients with histology-proven LCIS were described and compared with surgical specimens. Aspirates from 8/21 cases had cell groups diagnostic for or compatible with LCIS. Aspirates from an additional two cases demonstrated hypercellular, dissociated, and more pleomorphic tumor cells, which were originally diagnosed as invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). The remaining 11 aspirates were diagnosed as benign or nondiagnostic. FNAC from the eight diagnostic specimens were characterized by loosely cohesive cell groups composed of uniform cells with occasional intracytoplasmic lumina, slightly irregular and eccentric nuclei. We conclude that the main difficulty in diagnosing LCIS by FNAC is sampling rather than recognition of the lesions. However, one should be aware of the cytological features of LCIS in order to reach a correct diagnosis. There are no reliable cytological criteria that help in differentiating pleomorphic and dissociated LCIS from ILC.			Risberg, Bjorn/A-6447-2008											8755-1039		10.1002/dc.10128																		
J	BCI:BCI200200379832	12115488			Diagnostic accuracy of stereotactic large-core needle biopsy for nonpalpable breast disease: Results of a multicenter prospective study with 95% surgical confirmation		Verkooijen, Helena M.									International Journal of Cancer		2002	20 June, 2002	99	6	853-859	853	859							Stereotactic large-core needle biopsy is increasingly applied for the diagnosis of nonpalpable breast disease. Our study examines whether this minimally invasive technique is sufficiently accurate to replace surgical breast biopsy. In a prospective multicenter study, 973 consecutive women with 1,029 nonpalpable breast lesions were offered stereotactic 14-gauge needle biopsy. If the needle biopsy yielded breast cancer, the patient was offered therapeutic surgery. Surgical biopsy was proposed in cases of needle biopsies without malignancy. An expert panel reviewed all discrepancies in histologic diagnosis between the needle biopsy and open biopsy. Forty-five patients withdrew from participation and 113 (11%) planned needle biopsy procedures were cancelled. Of the 871 successful biopsy procedures, 95% were confirmed surgically. In 13 cases (1.5%), insufficient material was obtained for histologic assessment. Fifty-five percent of the needle biopsies were diagnosed as malignant (290 invasive cancers, 190 ductal carcinoma in situ). Thirteen of the 322 lesions (4%, 95% CI 2-7%) with a benign needle biopsy diagnosis contained malignancy after surgery. Six of the 26 (23%, 95% CI 9-44%) lesions with a high-risk diagnosis (atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ) were diagnosed as malignant after surgery. Five of the 30 lesions containing normal breast tissue held malignancy (17%, 95% CI 6-35%). Guidelines for the management of different categories of needle biopsy diagnoses were made. Application of these guidelines to the present findings resulted in sensitivity and specificity rates of 97% (95% CI 95-98%) and 99% (95% CI 97-100%), respectively. Stereotactic large-core needle biopsy is an accurate diagnostic instrument for nonpalpable breast disease. It may safely replace needle localised open-breast biopsy provided that high-risk and normal breast tissue diagnoses are followed by needle or open-breast biopsy.														0020-7136		10.1002/ijc.10419

Angela									Oncogene		2002	9 May, 2002	21	20	3241-3246	3241	3246							Snail is a zinc finger transcription factor that triggers the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by directly repressing E-cadherin expression. Snail is required for mesoderm and neural crest formation during embryonic development and has recently been implicated in the EMT associated with tumour progression. In a series of human breast carcinomas, we have analysed the expression of Snail and that of molecules of the E-cadherin/catenin complexes. We have also correlated these data with the pathological features of the tumours. We show that Snail expression inversely correlates with the grade of differentiation of the tumours and that it is expressed in all the infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDC) presenting lymph node metastases that were analysed. In addition, Snail is expressed in some dedifferentiated tumours with a negative nodal status. Considering that Snail is involved in the induction of the invasive and migratory phenotype in epithelial cells, these results indicate that it is also involved in the progression of breast ductal tumours, where it could additionally serve as a marker of the metastatic potential.

Nuclear Medicine Communications		2002	May, 2002	23	5	461-467	461	467							This study was performed to investigate the relationship between histological type and grade, with the uptake and washout of 99mTc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-sestamibi, 99mTc-MIBI) and 99mTcV-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTcV-DMSA) in breast cancer. Forty-five patients with histologically proven breast cancer had previously been referred for 99mTcV-DMSA and/or 99mTc-MIBI scintimammography. Twenty-five of them underwent both 99mTcV-DMSA and 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy in a double phase study. Lateral prone and anterior supine images were acquired at 15 and 60 min after administration of 740-925 MBq of each radiotracer. Uptake ratios and retention index were calculated and correlated with histology and grade of malignancy. Histology showed eight different histotypes: 77.7% were infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinomas. Mammography was definitely positive in 32/45, indeterminate in 10 and negative in three cases (sensitivity 71%). 99mTcV-DMSA was true positive in 37/40 (sensitivity 92.5%) and 99mTc-MIBI in 28/30 (sensitivity 93.3%) breast cancers. Uptake ratios were significantly higher in ductal than in lobular carcinomas on 99mTcV-DMSA and 99mTc-MIBI scintigrams at early and delayed phases. Grade II carcinomas had significantly lower values of retention index (rapid washout) than grade III carcinomas. This finding was statistically significant only on 99mTc-MIBI scans and was observed in ductal and lobular carcinomas. The retention index did not show any significant difference between ductal and lobular carcinomas. Uptake ratios were also not statistically different between grade II and III cancers. It is concluded that 99mTc-MIBI and 99mTcV-DMSA uptake in breast cancer is probably related to histological type and may distinguish ductal from lobular carcinomas. To a certain degree, the washout rate may reflect the histological grade, but since grade is not the only factor influencing this phenomenon it should be explored further in conjunction with other parameters by multivariate analysis in order to clarify eventual indirect correlations.														0143-3636		10.1097/00006231-200205000-00006

British Journal of Cancer		2002	8 April, 2002	86	7	1097-1103	1097	1103							Fibroblast growth factor 8 can transform NIH3T3 cells and its expression has been found to be associated with breast and prostate cancer. Following our finding that fibroblast growth factor 8 mRNA expression is increased in breast cancer, we have undertaken an immunohistochemistry study of fibroblast growth factor 8 expression in a series of human breast tissues and other normal tissues. Our findings confirm increased expression of fibroblast growth factor 8 in malignant breast tissue but also show significant fibroblast growth factor 8 expression in non-malignant breast epithelial cells. No significant difference in fibroblast growth factor 8 expression was found between different grades of ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in-situ or cancer of different oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor or nodal status. The highest levels of fibroblast growth factor 8 expression were found in lactating breast tissues and fibroblast growth factor 8 was also detected in human milk. A survey of other normal tissues showed that fibroblast growth factor 8 is expressed in the proliferative cells of the dermis and epithelial cells in colon, ovary fallopian tube and uterus. Fibroblast growth factor 8 appears to be expressed in several organs in man and appears to have an importance in lactation.														0007-0920

B. V.									International Journal of Oncology		2002	April, 2002	20	4	717-721	717	721							Angiogenesis is intimately related to the growth and progression of tumours and must be induced to facilitate growth beyond a minimum size. It has been implicated in the development of metastases and survival in breast carcinoma. VEGF is a cytokine that plays an important role in angiogenesis. Its expression is increased in solid tumours during induction of angiogenesis and it has been implicated as a prognostic marker in patients with node negative breast carcinoma. We studied VEGF expression, in a series of patients with node positive breast carcinoma and examined histopathological parameters of the tumour and the prognostic value of VEGF expression. Specimens from 108 cases of node positive breast cancer were stained for VEGF using an antibody suitable for use on formalin fixed tissue. VEGF staining was cytoplasmic and was scored by intensity and the percent positive cells. Patients with positive VEGF staining (n=48) were compared with patients with negative VEGF staining (n=60). Demographic criteria were similar in both groups. Only one (12%) patient with lobular carcinoma and one (14%) patient with medullary carcinoma expressed VEGF compared with 46 (49%) patients with ductal carcinoma (NOS). DCIS was present in 60 tumours. There was a strong correlation between staining in DCIS and the adjacent invasive tumours. There was no significant association between VEGF staining and T stage, tumour size or the number of positive lymph nodes. VEGF expression had no prognostic significance either for disease-free or overall survival in patients with node positive disease. This study failed to support a role for VEGF as a prognostic marker in patients with node positive breast carcinoma.														1019-6439

Objective: To determine the morphologic and immunohistochemical spectrum of a consecutive series of ER-negative breast carcinomas, in an attempt to understand the pathogenesis and behavior of these lesions. Design: Seventy-four consecutive cases of ER-negative invasive carcinomas were studied. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections were reviewed, and new sections were stained for c-erbB-2, p53, vimentin, and androgen and prolactin receptors. The findings were correlated with the axillary lymph node status as a measure of tumor aggressiveness. Setting: The histopathology department of a tertiary referral teaching hospital. Results: The tumors included 50 (68%) invasive ductal carcinomas, 21 (28%) medullary/atypical medullary carcinomas, and 1 each of invasive lobular, apocrine, and papillary carcinoma. Some of the invasive ductal cases had distinctive features that are described in this report. Maximum tumor diameter varied between 5 and 100 mm. Sixty tumors (81%) were grade 3, 13 (18%) were grade 2, and 1 (1%) was grade 1. Of the 60 cases in which the axillary node status was known, 34 (57%) had metastases, and 26 did not. Tumors associated with positive nodes were significantly larger than those associated with negative nodes (37.2 vs 17.8 mm, P<.001). A higher percentage of node-negative tumors were c-erbB-2 positive (42% vs 21%, P<.05). There were no differences between the 2 groups with regard to histologic type, tumor grade, or the expression of p53, vimentin, or androgen or prolactin receptors. Conclusions: Many ER-negative breast carcinomas have distinctive microscopic features. Not all ER-negative tumors are aggressive, as judged by the absence of lymph node metastases in 43% of cases in this series. Tumor size is the most important indicator for the likelihood of the presence of lymph node metastases. The wide range of tumor sizes encountered in this series suggests that the ER status of a tumor is determined early in its natural history and supports the existence of 2 separate pathways for the development of ER-negative and ER-positive breast carcinomas.														0363-0153

Although somatic mutations of the BRCA1 gene are rare in sporadic breast cancers, a high incidence of reduced BRCA1 immunoreactivity has been demonstrated. As one of the mechanisms for this, gene silencing by hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter region has been reported. Here, we show the presence of a post-transcriptional mechanism by examining promoter hypermethylation, mRNA expression levels and immunoreactivity of BRCA1 in sporadic human breast cancers. Methods: Paired samples of 20 invasive ductal carcinomas and one invasive lobular carcinoma were obtained from sporadic breast cancer cases. The BRCA1 protein expression levels were determined by immunohistochemistry using a well-characterized antibody. The methylation status of the BRCA1 promoter region was determined by sequencing after bisulfite modification. The mRNA expression levels were determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mutations in the entire BRCA1 coding region were analyzed by PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Results: Reduced immunoreactivity was observed in 13 of the 21 cancers. Hypermethylation was observed in five of the 13 cancers with reduced immunoreactivity and mRNA expression was almost absent in these five cancers. In the remaining eight cancers, mRNA expression was not decreased. None of the 21 cancers examined harbored BRCA1 mutations. Conclusion: These findings showed that post-transcriptional mechanisms, such as low efficiency of translation or reduced stability of BRCA1 protein, are also involved in reduced BRCA1 immunoreactivity in sporadic breast cancers.

J	BCI:BCI200200198486	11836618			Expression and amplification of cyclin D1 in primary breast carcinomas: Relationship with histopathological types and clinico-pathological parameters		Naidu, Rakesh; Wahab, Norhanom Abdul; Yadav, Man Mohan; Kutty, Methil Kannan									Oncology Reports		2002	March-April, 2002	9	2	409-416	409	416							Overexpression and amplification of cyclin D1 were investigated by immunohistochemistry and differential polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) in 440 formalin-fixed primary breast carcinoma tissues. Overexpression of cyclin D1 was detected in 60% (263/440) and amplification of cyclin D1 was noted in 27% (119/440) of the primary breast carcinomas. Molecular analysis demonstrated that cyclin D1 was amplified in 30% (7/23) of the comedo DCIS, 22% (9/41) of the comedo DCIS and 32% (13/41) of the adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas, 30% (82/270) of the invasive ductal carcinomas, 27% (9/33) of the invasive lobular carcinomas, 19% (4/21) of the colloid carcinomas and 13% (2/15) of the medullary carcinomas. Cyclin D1 was amplified in 11% (2/19) of the invasive ductal carcinomas but not in the adjacent non-comedo DCIS lesions. Our observation showed that cyclin D1 was strongly positive in 61% (14/23) of the comedo subtype, 61% (11/18) of the non-comedo subtype, 59% (24/41) of the comedo DCIS and 63% (26/41) of the adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas, 53% (10/19) of the non-comedo DCIS and 58% (11/19) of the adjacent invasive lesions, 58% (157/270) of the invasive ductal carcinomas, 73% (24/33) of the invasive lobular carcinomas, 52% (11/21) of the colloid carcinomas and 27% (4/15) of the medullary carcinomas. A significant association was observed between in situ components and adjacent invasive lesions for cyclin D1 expression (p<0.05) and amplification (p<0.05). A significant relationship was noted between amplification of cyclin D1 and lymph node metastases (p<0.05) but not with histological grade (p>0.05), estrogen receptor status (p>0.05) and proliferation index (Ki-67 and PCNA) (p>0.05). However, overexpression of cyclin D1 was statistically associated with well differentiated tumors (p<0.05) and estrogen receptor positivity (p<0.05). No relationship was seen with nodal status (p>0.05) and proliferation index (Ki-67 and PCNA) (p>0.05). These observations suggest that tumors positive for cyclin D1 protein may have features of good prognosis but amplification of cyclin D1 gene could be an indicator of tumors with poor prognostic features. Although majority of the Malaysian patients belong to younger age group (<50 years old), amplification and expression of cyclin D1 was not statistically associated with patient age (p>0.05). These observations indicate that amplification and up-regulation of cyclin D1 may be independent of patient age. Moreover, overexpression and amplification of cyclin D1 in preinvasive, preinvasive and adjacent invasive lesions, and invasive carcinomas suggest that the gene may play an important role in early and late stages of breast carcinogenesis.

Another goal was a search for a relationship/or its lack/between the occurrence of the new generation markers of neoplastic disease and a presence/or absence/of lymph node metastases. U-PA, PAI-1 and PAI-2 antigen levels were determined by ELISA tests in protein extracts of breast cancer tissues. Among the studied breast tumors 32 specimens were ductal carcinomas, 15 specimens were lobular carcinomas and the remaining 13 were other rare histological forms. In comparison to the obtained values of u-PA antigen levels in normal tissue, the values in neoplastic tissues were elevated several times: 11-fold, 6-fold and 15-fold in ductal c., lobular c. and other rare neoplasms. The values of PAI-1 antigen levels were about 20-fold higher for all studied, histologically defined primary breast cancers. The greatest differences of PAI-2 antigen levels growth was observed in histologically defined primary breast cancer forms. It was augmented 10-fold, 40-fold and 20-fold, respectively, for ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma and rare forms of neoplasms. In various forms of invasive breast cancer and those without lymph node metastases the content of u-PA, PAI-1 and PAI-2 were also significantly elevated. Among the new generation of independent markers of the neoplastic process, PAI-2 seems to be the most reliable marker for the identification of primary breast cancer. The goal of the present study was to evaluate a possible combined prognostic value of the three major components of the u-PA system (u-PA, PAI-1 and PAI-2) in patients with defined histopathological forms of primary breast cancer.														0939-5075

Methods: We conducted a population-based, case-control study among female residents of Connecticut to identify risk factors for breast carcinoma in situ. Case patients, diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (n = 875) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (n = 123), were matched by 5-year age groups with control subjects (n = 999). Case patients were diagnosed between September 15, 1994, through March 14, 1998, and all subjects were between the ages of 20 and 79 years. Information on risk factors and cancer-screening history was collected by telephone interviews. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine odds ratios (ORs) for the association of these factors with the risk of DCIS and LCIS. Results: Case patients with DCIS were more likely than control subjects to report a family history of breast cancer (OR = 1.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19 to 1.85) or previous breast biopsy (OR = 3.56; 95% CI = 2.86 to 4.43). They also had fewer full-term pregnancies (OR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.80 to 0.93) and were older at first full-term pregnancy (OR for being 20-29 years old relative to being <20 years old = 1.68; 95% CI = 1.17 to 2.43) and at menopause (OR for being gtoreq55 years old relative to being <45 years old = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.05 to 2.77). DCIS case patients were more likely than control subjects to have had a mammographic examination (OR = 2.46; 95% CI = 1.78 to 3.40) or an annual clinical breast examination (OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.48 to 2.26). DCIS patients and control subjects did not differ with respect to oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy, alcohol consumption or smoking history, or breast self-examination. Associations for LCIS were similar. Conclusions: The risk factors associated with DCIS and LCIS are similar to those associated with invasive breast cancer. Diagnosis of DCIS is associated with increased mammography screening.														0027-8874		10.1093/jnci/93.23.1811

J	BCI:BCI200100523970	11585740			Collagenase-3 expression in breast myofibroblasts as a molecular marker of transition of ductal carcinoma in situ lesions to invasive ductal carcinomas		Nielsen, Boye Schnack; Rank, Fritz; Lopez, Jose Manuel; Balbin, Milagros; Vizoso, Francisco; Lund, Leif Roge; Dano, Keld; Lopez-Otin, Carlos									Cancer Research		2001	October 1, 2001	61	19	7091-7100	7091	7100							Collagenase-3 (matrix metalloproteinase 13; MMP-13), a protease originally identified in breast carcinoma, is characterized by a potent degrading activity against a wide spectrum of extracellular matrix proteins. The aims of this study were to localize and identify the MMP-13-expressing cells in invasive human breast carcinoma and to evaluate the role of MMP-13 in transition to invasive lesions by studying ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We found expression of MMP-13 in stromal fibroblast-like cells in all 21 invasive ductal carcinomas studied and in 4 of 9 invasive lobular carcinomas. In most carcinomas, expression of MMP-13 was limited to small stromal foci in the tumor area. Combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed coexpression of alpha-smooth muscle actin immunoreactivity and MMP-13 mRNA in myofibroblasts. In contrast, cytokeratin-positive cancer cells, alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive vascular smooth muscle cells, CD68-positive macrophages, and CD31-positive endothelial cells were all MMP-13 mRNA negative. In situ hybridization for MMP-13 in 17 DCIS lesions revealed expression in 10 cases. Immunohistochemical analysis of all DCIS cases identified microinvasion in 8 of the 17 lesions. Seven of the eight lesions with microinvasion were MMP-13 positive. Further analysis showed that MMP-13 expression was often associated with the microinvasive events. This particular expression pattern was unique for MMP-13 among other MMPs analyzed, including MMP-2, -11, and -14. We conclude that MMP-13 is primarily expressed by myofibroblasts in human breast carcinoma and that expression in DCIS lesions often is associated with microinvasive events. On the basis of these data, we propose that MMP-13 may play an essential role during transition of DCIS lesions to invasive ductal carcinomas.

Diff-Quik-stained cytologic preparations showed uniform single cells with prominent coarse cytoplasmic granules. Ultrastructurally, the granules showed features suggestive of autophagosomes and/or degenerative mitochondria. The cytologic differential diagnosis included granulocytic sarcoma, metastatic melanoma, extramedullary hematopoiesis, large granulocytic leukemia/lymphoma, and mast-cell tumor. Adjunctive studies were helpful in the diagnosis of carcinoma.

J	BCI:BCI200100502878	11592098			The pattern of expression of the microtubule-binding protein RHAMM/IHABP in mammary carcinoma suggests a role in the invasive behaviour of tumour cells		Assmann, Volker; Gillett, Cheryl E.; Poulsom, Richard; Ryder, Kenneth; Hart, Ian R.; Hanby, Andrew M.									Journal of Pathology		2001	September, 2001	195	2	191-196	191	196							Intracellular hyaluronic acid binding protein (RHAMM/IHABP), which was recently identified as a novel member of the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) family, has the capacity to interact not only with microtubules but also with microfilaments. The molecule, which is known to be expressed in mammary carcinoma cells, might, through virtue of its intracellular interactions, influence tumour cell morphology and motility. This possibility was examined in a series of 189 mammary carcinomas by immunohistochemistry, using a polyclonal antibody to RHAMM/IHABP. Tumours were selected to include approximately equal numbers of consecutive grade I, II and III ductal carcinomas and invasive lobular carcinomas. Higher grade tumours had significantly lower expression of RHAMM/IHABP in the cytoplasm (p=0.02), but significantly increased expression in trabeculae (p=0.002) and further enhancement at the tumour island edges (p=0.002). Tumours of infiltrating lobular type had stronger expression in the overall cytoplasm (p=0.02) and trabeculae (p=0.08) than carcinomas of ductal type. The presence of strong trabecular expression was associated with a reduced overall survival time (p=0.017). These results suggest that RHAMM/IHABP expression may contribute to the motility and invasiveness of a tumour cell sub-population in breast cancers.														0022-3417		10.1002/path.941

American Journal of Clinical Pathology		2001	July, 2001	116	1	92-96	92	96							We reviewed the results of all breast core needle biopsies with a diagnosis of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) or atypia not otherwise specified and subsequent excisional biopsies for a 50-month period and correlated the results. Of 3,026 biopsies, 216 were diagnosed as ADH or atypia not otherwise specified, and subsequent resection was available for 105. After review, 95 qualified as ADH. Subsequent resection showed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in 13 excisions, ADH in 31, lobular carcinoma in situ in 6, and benign proliferative lesions in the remaining 45. In none of the 8 biopsies in which DCIS was found and radiographs were available for review was the radiographic lesion entirely removed. For comparison, the incidence of carcinoma in resections done for a diagnosis of DCIS, low or intermediate grade (solid, cribriform, or micropapillary type), on core needle biopsy was significantly greater (8 of 10 cases). However, the size of the lesions diagnosed as carcinoma also was significantly greater than that of the lesions diagnosed as ADH, and in none of the 8 biopsies with DCIS at excision was the lesion entirely removed at the time of biopsy. The incidence of carcinoma in excisional biopsies done for a diagnosis of ADH in core needle biopsies in our institution is relatively low, while the incidence of ADH is relatively high. Possible reasons for this include total removal of small lesions at the time of biopsy and use of the diagnostic term ADH for lesions that are not associated with coexistent DCIS.														0002-9173

Methods: The study consisted of 953 consective female breast biopsies and mastectomies. Information on these cases were retrieved from the records of the laboratory. Outline of breast lesions were tabulated and classified into inflammatory, benign and malignant lesions. Results: Benign lesions comprised 55.24% of all lesions (mean age 31.7), most commonly reported being fibroadenoma 46.9%, fibrocystic disease 23.25% and fibroadenosis 14.5%. Malignant lesion comprised 31.5% of all lesions (mean age 49.19), most commonly reported being ductal carcinoma 80% and lobular carcinoma 5.5%. Inflamatory lesions comprised of 10.1% of all lesions (mean age 29.56), most commonly reported lesion being chronic mastitis 30% and ducectasia 17.6%. Conclusion: The rates for female breast diseases varied in different studies but benign fibroadenoma was the most common breast lesion followed by ductal carcinoma. The mean age for malignant lesions in seven different studies was 44.18 years.														0030-9982

We examined this heterogeneity in a prospective series of inherited breast and ovarian cancers, previously demonstrated to include 84% of inherited cancers. Ninety-two tumours (65 breast and 27 ovarian) in 82 patients from 70 kindreds were prospectively diagnosed. Fifteen of the breast cancers were in situ, 50 were infiltrating. 40 (49%) of the 82 women carried a BRCA1 mutation, whereas no mutation in BRCA2 was found. Approximately, two-thirds of the BRCA1 mutation carriers had one of the four most frequent Norwegian founder mutations. Ninety-five per cent of the epithelial ovarian cancers occurred in BRCA1 mutation carrying women versus 38% of infiltrating breast cancers and 7% of carcinoma in situ of the breast. The BRCA1 syndrome was phenotypically distinct with invasive, high grade, oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancers and epithelial ovarian cancers. Non-BRCA1/2 inherited breast cancers included carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma and were frequently bilateral. Non-BRCA1/2 inherited breast cancer is not associated with epithelial ovarian cancer and in breast cancers has distinct biological characteristics, indicating that the different subgroups of inherited breast cancer may need different healthcare services.

American Journal of Clinical Pathology		2001	April, 2001	115	4	534-542	534	542							Studies suggest that E-cadherin is useful to classify epithelial breast lesions as ductal or lobular, but extensive experience with this antibody is lacking. We studied reactivity of lesions with classic and indeterminate morphologic features. We reviewed 95 lesions and divided them into unanimous and nonunanimous diagnosis groups; the unanimous group served as benchmark lesions to which E-cadherin reactivity could be standardized and compared. All 37 ductal lesions in the unanimous group had strong, diffuse E-cadherin reactivity. Two of 22 classic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) lesions had sparse E-cadherin-reactive lobular cells within a few terminal duct lobular units. Neither displayed transition from nonreactive to reactive cells. Of 36 lesions in the nonunanimous group, 19 had insufficient morphologic features for definitive classification. Only 6 of 19 were E-cadherin reactive, including several minimally proliferative lesions. The other 17 lesions in the nonunanimous group had LCIS and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) features. All had no E-cadherin, or strong membrane reactivity of constituent cells in varying proportions, without a transition between reactive and nonreactive cells. Results suggest that the majority of morphologically nondiagnostic atypical lesions are lobular, including those associated with DCIS. E-cadherin seems to be absent in most lobular lesions.														0002-9173

Invasive lobular cancers are seen very rarely because of the absence of lobules in the male breast. Genetic abnormalities such as Klinefelter's syndrome can increase the risk of breast cancer, and it is thought that there has to be some cytoarchitectural abnormality for development of lobular cancers in men.														0960-9776		10.1054/brst.2000.0178

Human Pathology		2001	March, 2001	32	3	292-296	292	296							Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and infiltrating lobular carcinoma may represent different forms of the same disease based on their frequent clinical association and similar histologic features. Patients with LCIS are at increased risk of multicentric and bilateral disease. Thus, LCIS may represent both a precursor to infiltrating lobular carcinoma and a marker of risk for breast cancer. To identify genomic alterations in LCIS, comparative genomic hybridization was performed on 17 cases without concurrent invasive carcinoma. Loss involving chromosome 16q was present in 88% of cases and was the sole detected alteration in 29%. Gain involving 1q was second in frequency, occurring in 41% of tumors, and in all cases was associated with loss of 16q. Other recurrent changes were loss involving 17p (18%), 8p (12%), and 12q24 (12%). E-cadherin immunohistochemistry was performed on all LCIS cases to evaluate the correlation of loss involving 16q22, the site of the E-cadherin gene, and altered protein expression. Most cases with 16q22 loss showed altered E-cadherin expression (12 of 13). These results in LCIS are similar to changes reported in infiltrating lobular cancer, confirming a genetic relationship between them.														0046-8177		10.1053/hupa.2001.22759

D.									Journal of Clinical Pathology (London)		2001	January, 2001	54	1	70-73	70	73							An unusual mixed form of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is described, which exhibits a biphenotypic morphology encompassing a range of differential diagnostic DCIS subtypes. In adddition, immunophenotypic and ultrastructural studies demonstrate neuroendocrine and apocrine differentiation, raising questions regarding appropriate classification and biological behaviour. In two cases, coexistence of this mixed form of DCIS with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) in the same duct lobular units is an additional unusual feature that might, at least in some cases, indicate a closer relation between them.														0021-9746		10.1136/jcp.54.1.70

American Journal of Surgical Pathology		2000	December, 2000	24	12	1593-1599	1593	1599							Some patients with breast cancer currently undergo bone marrow biopsy to make clinical decisions regarding therapy; however, lobular carcinoma can be difficult to detect in routine histologic sections. The authors reviewed retrospectively all available bone marrow biopsies from patients with lobular carcinoma diagnosed between January, 1, 1989, and September, 25, 1997, at the City of Hope National Medical Center to identify useful morphologic features and to determine the utility of pan-keratin immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. A total of 65 biopsies from 54 patients were reviewed. Thirteen of the 65 biopsies were classified initially as containing metastatic tumor based on histologic features alone. With the addition of keratin IHC, seven additional cases of metastatic disease were detected. Forty of the 54 patients received stem cell replacement or autologous bone marrow transplantation. Disease-free survival after high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell replacement or autologous bone marrow transplantation was stratified into three groups based on hematoxylin and eosin (HalphampE) staining and IHC results. Two-year disease-free survival was 33% for the HalphampE-/IHC+ group versus 90% for the HalphampE-/IHC- group (p = 0.005) among patients clinically free of disease at the time of stem cell replacement or autologous bone marrow transplantation. Two-year disease-free survival was 0% in the HalphampE+/IHC+ group (p = 0.04, compared with the HalphampE-/IHC+ group). The authors conclude that routine morphologic examination without the aid of keratin IHC is unreliable in detecting clinically relevant metastatic lobular carcinoma in bone marrow biopsies. These findings suggest that pan-keratin immunostaining may be indicated on bone marrow biopsy specimens from lobular carcinoma patients if the biopsy appears histologically negative for metastatic tumor on HalphampE sections.														0147-5185		10.1097/00000478-200012000-00002

However, a considerable fraction of women receive no benefit from this treatment. This study investigates whether a number of biopathological factors can influence the outcome of patients submitted to adjuvant chemotherapy involving the use of high-dose epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. Methods: One hundred and fifty-seven primary breast cancer patients, considered at high risk according to the St. Gallen Meeting Consensus Conference, were evaluated immunohistochemically for estrogen, progesterone receptors, p53, bcl-2, HER-2/neu, and Ki-67, of which the results were correlated with patient outcome. Results: Results obtained demonstrated that p53 is a significant predictor of disease-free survival (DFS P < 0.0001) and overall survival (OS P = 0.0002) both in ductal and lobular carcinomas, whereas bcl-2 expression seems to be of prognostic value only in lobular carcinomas (DFS P = 0.01; OS P = 0.02). Conclusions: This data indicates that in high-risk breast cancer patients the immunohistochemical evaluation of p53 and bcl-2 may be of clinical value in distinguishing different responses to adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2000	August, 2000	62	3	197-210	197	210							In a Danish nationwide prospective study of in situ carcinoma of the breast, a total of 275 women, treated with excision alone, were registered from 1982 to 1989. The series included 142 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 100 cases of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), 26 cases of DCIS+LCIS, and seven cases of atypical hyperplasia (AH). Within a median follow-up of 120 months, a crude recurrence rate of 28% (76 cases) was found, of which 53% (40 cases) recurred as invasive carcinomas (IC) and 47% (36 cases) as CIS. CIS recurrences appeared after median 18 months, compared to median 42 months for IC recurrences. No statistical difference was found with respect to development of IC between the three groups of DCIS, DCIS+LCIS, and LCIS. The majority of recurrences were ipsilateral, also for LCIS. Forty four of 49 recurrences following DCIS, and seven of nine recurrences following DCIS+LCIS occurred as local recurrences. Histopathologically, in DCIS a strong association was found between large nuclear size and comedonecrosis. Univariate analysis showed a significant association to recurrence for nuclear size, comedonecrosis, and size of the original lesion. Multivariate analysis showed that only comedonecrosis and size of lesion were independent predictors of recurrence, however, specimen margins were not included in the analysis, as this parameter could not be adequately evaluated in the present series. Nuclear size of original DCIS lesion was related to histologic grade of the IC recurrence. The recurrence rate for DCIS of small nuclear size increased from 6% at five years of follow-up to 16% at 10 years, possibly due to a slower growth rate and a continued but delayed risk. Similarities were found between LCIS and DCIS of small nuclear size, both showing a continued risk and comparable rate of recurrence. Further, progression to IC of similar, highly differentiated type was seen, indicating a linkage between biological behavior of the two histological types.														0167-6806		10.1023/A:1006453915590

Experimental and Molecular Pathology		2000	August, 2000	69	1	27-36	27	36							RAK antigens p120, p42, and p25 exhibit molecular and immunological similarity to the proteins encoded by HIV-1 and are expressed by 95% of breast and gynecological cancer cases in women and prostate cancer cases in men. Binding of the monoclonal antibody (MAb) RAK-BrI to cancer RAK antigens has been found to be inhibited by a peptide derived from the variable loop V3 of HIV-1. Since MAb RAK-BrI has been developed against denatured froms of breast cancer proteins, and it binds to a short epitope, GRAF, this MAb does not recognize the native, three-dimensional structure of proteins. Subsequently Western blot, after electrophoretic separation in gels with SDS, has been used to detect these unique cancer markers. The current studies were focused on the immunohistochemical evaluation of the novel marker RAK. Serial sections, 5 mum thick, were cut from frozen or Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and immunostained with MAb RAK-BrI. All of the 53 cases of breast cancer tested RAK positive and no differences were observed in the immunohistochemical staining of lobular and ductal carcinoma cases. In contrast, MAb RAK-BrI antigens were detected in only 3 of 15 cases of macroscopically normal breast removed during mastectomy for breast cancer. It is noteworthy that Western blots of breast samples from the same series demonstrated a high expression of three RAK antigens in 20/20 of invasive breast carcinomas, while there was only a very weak expression of RAK antigens in 2/7 of the macroscopically "normal" breast samples. Due to the suspected viral origin of RAK markers, immunohistochemical staining with MAb RAK-BrI might be a useful tool in the early detection of malignant changes occurring in breast tissues.														0014-4800		10.1006/exmp.2000.2310																		
J	BCI:BCI200000285574	10861434			Changing incidence rate of invasive lobular breast carcinoma among older women		Li, Christopher I.; Anderson, Benjamin O.; Porter, Peggy; Holt, Sarah K.; Daling, Janet R.; Moe, Roger E.									Cancer		2000	June 1, 2000	88	11	2561-2569	2561	2569							BACKGROUND: In 1998, an unusually large number of invasive lobular breast carcinoma cases were seen at the University of Washington. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the incidence rate of invasive lobular carcinoma has been increasing disproportionately compared with the incidence rate of invasive ductal carcinoma. METHODS: Age specific and age-adjusted breast carcinoma incidence rates from 1977-1995 were obtained from the nine population-based cancer registries that participate in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Three histologic groupings were used: lobular, ductal, and all invasive breast carcinomas. Overall incidence rates for each grouping, as well as for each stage (local, regional, and distant), were obtained. RESULTS: The rate of incidence of lobular carcinoma increased steadily from 1977-1995 in women age gtoreq 50 years whereas it remained stable in women age < 50 years. Alternatively, the rate of incidence of ductal carcinoma increased steadily from 1977-1987, but from 1987-1995 it remained relatively constant across all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rates of invasive lobular breast carcinomas increased steadily since 1977 whereas the incidence rates of invasive ductal carcinoma have plateaued since 1987. This rise occurred specifically among women age gtoreq 50 years and may be related to postmenopausal status. Further epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory research is required to assess what factors are contributing to this trend.														0008-543X		10.1002/1097-0142(20000601)88:11<2561::AID-CNCR19>3.3.CO;2-O

Cancer		2000	June 1, 2000	88	11	2570-2577	2570	2577							BACKGROUND: In the majority of studies, long term, recent use of hormone replacement therapy has been associated with an increased risk of breast carcinoma. However, little attention has been paid to the possibility that the magnitude of this association may vary according to the histologic type of breast carcinoma. METHODS: In this population-based case-control study, interviews were conducted with 537 female residents of King County, Washington who were ages 50-64 years and who had been diagnosed with primary breast carcinoma between January 1, 1988 and June 30, 1990. Interviews with 492 randomly selected King County women without a history of breast carcinoma served as a basis for comparison. Analyses were performed separately for women with lobular and for those with ductal tumors. RESULTS: Compared with nonusers of menopausal hormones, those who currently were using combined estrogen and progestin hormone replacement therapy (CHRT) and had done so for at least 6 months had an elevated risk of lobular breast carcinoma (odds ratio (OR) = 2.6; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.1-5.8), but no change in their risk of ductal breast carcinoma was noted (OR = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-1.1). The OR associated with current use of unopposed estrogen for at least 6 months was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.5-3.9) for lobular tumors and 0.7 (95% CI, 0.4-1.1) for ductal tumors. Similar results were found when cases of invasive tumor were analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that CHRT use increases the risk of lobular, but not ductal, breast carcinoma in middle-aged women.														0008-543X		10.1002/1097-0142(20000601)88:11<2570::AID-CNCR20>3.0.CO;2-O

The finer details of the differences between CLC and variant lobular carcinoma (VLC) have not been adequately studied. A comparative study of 54 cases of CLC and VLC was done in order to verify any statistically significant differences between them. All cases had histologic confirmation of the diagnosis. Six parameters, which included cellularity, signet-ring cells, intracytoplasmic lumina (ICL), anisonucleosis, cell size, and prominent nucleoli, were studied. The only statistically significant findings were cellularity and cell size when compared to CLC. The cellularity in VLC was higher and the cells in VLC were larger when compared to CLC. There are no definite diagnostic features to identify VLC; however, in a cellular specimen with plenty of large cells with other features of LC, one should have a high index of suspicion of VLC.														8755-1039		10.1002/(SICI)1097-0339(200006)22:6<370::AID-DC8>3.0.CO;2-F

M.; de la Cruz Vigo, F.; Escudero, M.									Oncologia (Madrid)		2000		23	1	45-52	45	52							Purpose: Breast lobular carcinoma has unique features distinguishing it from breast ductal carcinoma. It is frequently multicentric and bilateral, has positive spreading edges, affects the contralateral breast, and invades the axillary lymph nodes. We analyse the prognostic value of these and other factors and their influence upon survival. Material and methods: A multi-Center study was carried out in a population of 390 patients to evaluate the characteristics defining the prognosis of stages I, II and III invasive breast lobular carcinoma observed between 1980 and 1997. Tumor size, degree of axillary affection, positive spreading of the piece edges, tissue malignancy, multicentric character, and state of the tumor receptors were considered, trying to correlate them with long term survival. Results and conclusions: From a statistical point of view, the axillary affection, size of the tumor at the moment of detection, and grade of histological malignancy were the features more influencing the prognosis. The multicentric character and the positive edges treated by re-excicion did not affect survival.														0378-4835																				
J	BCI:BCI200000065288	10597188			Expression of glycodelin in human breast and breast cancer		Kamarainen, Meerit; Halttunen, Mervi; Koistinen, Riitta; von Boguslawsky, Kristina; von Smitten, Karl; Andersson, Leif C.; Seppala, Markku									International Journal of Cancer		1999	Dec. 10, 1999	83	6	738-742	738	742							Glycodelin is a 28 kDa glycoprotein with structural homology to beta-lactoglobulins, particularly expressed in steroid-responsive tissues of the female reproductive tract. We previously found that transfection of glycodelin cDNA into MCF-7 breast cancer cells induces differentiation into organized acinar epithelium and up-regulation of epithelial markers. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry, Northern blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses to study glycodelin expression in normal and in malignant breast tissues. The results were compared with the expression of estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) and p53 tumor suppressor protein. Glycodelin was found in ductal and lobular epithelium of 6/6 normal breast tissues, 27/29 morphologically normal breast tissues from breast cancer patients, 6/6 benign lactating adenomas, 21/35 ductal carcinomas, 9/9 tubular carcinomas, 9/9 mucinous carcinomas, 3/3 mixed ductal/tubular carcinomas and 7/11 lobular carcinomas. In the latter, of particular interest was the presence of glycodelin in paranucleolar vacuoles of carcinoma cells. Northern blot analysis of fresh frozen tissues revealed the normal full length 0.9 kb mRNA of glycodelin in ductal breast carcinoma. Using RT-PCR analysis, glycodelin messenger ribonucleic acid was found in 13/13 ductal and in 3/3 tubular tumor tissues. We also detected a splicing variant lacking exon 4, which includes the nucleotide sequence encoding the potential N-glycosylation site at Asn-85. Our results demonstrate the synthesis of glycodelin in normal breast and breast cancer. In addition, we show that the paranuclear vacuole, characteristically present in lobular breast cancer cells, contains abundant amounts of glycodelin.														0020-7136		10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19991210)83:6<738::AID-IJC7>3.0.CO;2-F

Comparison with prognostic factors		Dalifard, Isabelle; Daver, Alain; Larra, Francis									Anticancer Research		1999	Nov.-Dec., 1999	19	6b	5015-5022	5015	5022							Mutations of the TP53 gene induce the production of an abnormal protein (p53) with a prolonged half-life allowing its detection by monoclonal antibodies and leading to a development of serum p53 autoantibodies. We have quantified the protein p53 in 196 cytosols of primary breast cancer tissues, by an immunoluminometric method and searched for p53 autoantibodies in the sera of 101 patients, by an immunoenzymatic assay. The median value has been chosen as cut-off (0.26 ng/mg protein). 18.4% of tumors had a p53 level < 0.10 ng/mg protein, and 8.2% had a p53 level gtoreq 2.5 ng/mg protein (range: 0-43.37). We found a significant difference between p53 distribution (p = 0.003) and median level (p = 0.001) in ductal and lobular carcinomas. The p53 median levels were significantly different between the grade III versus the grade I tumors (p = 0.01) and versus the grade II tumors (p = 0.008). An inverse correlation was obtained between p53 levels and ER (p = 0.003) alone or with PR (p = 0.006). p53 autoantibodies were detected in 7.9% of cases (8/101). This p53 study shows correlations with some poor prognostic factors, but would require further evaluation to better define the patient groups with poor prognosis. The p53 detection autoantibodies is neither correlated with the p53 cytosolic assay nor with prognostic factors of breast cancer, and should therefore not be used for patient the selection of the patient groups with poor prognosis.														0250-7005

K.; Derakhshandeh-Peykar, P.; Freihoff, D.; Brandau, O.; Meindl, A.									Disease Markers		1999	Oct. 1999	15	1-3	123	123								Germline mutations of E-cadherin have been identified in families with gastric cancer. Moreover, E-cadherin has been shown to be inactivated in the majority of human invasive lobular breast cancers. E-cadherin is a tumor suppressor gene located in 16q22.1, a region which is frequently deleted in a variety of tumors. We therefore analysed 15 families with lobular breast cancer or breast and gastric cancer for germline mutations and 20 sporadic lobular breast carcinomas for somatic mutations in the E-cadherin gene. Screening of the lobular breast cancer families revealed two germline mutations of the missense type (A592T, P692L). One of these mutations (A592T) has previously been identified in a sporadic papillary thyroid tumor. No germline mutations were found in breast and gastric cancer associated families. Only 2 mutations could be identified in the tumor panel. Both were of the frameshift type and associated with LOH causing inactivation of E-cadherin. We here report for the first time germline mutations in the E-cadherin gene in families with lobular breast carcinomas. In addition, the frequency of E-cadherin mutations in our panel of lobular breast carcinomas is lower than published in former studies.														0278-0240		10.1155/1999/519258

Modern Pathology		1999	Oct., 1999	12	10	941-945	941	945							Background: Core needle biopsies (CNB) are being used increasingly as the initial diagnostic procedure in women with breast cancer. Many clinicians are interested in obtaining as much prognostic information as possible from these limited specimens. However, the accuracy of assessing pathologic prognostic factors in core biopsy material has not been studied in detail. Design: We studied CNB and subsequent excision specimens from 79 women with invasive breast cancer. Slides from CNB and excision specimens were reviewed in a blinded fashion and each was assessed for histologic type, tumor size, histologic grade, lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI), and the presence of an extensive intraductal component (EIC). Results: Among the 79 cancers, there were 58 invasive ductal carcinomas, six invasive lobular carcinomas, 13 invasive carcinomas with ductal and lobular features and two tubular carcinomas, based on examination of the excision specimens. Histologic type on CNB correlated with that on exc ision in 64 cases (81%). Although there was a significant correlation between tumor size on CNB and excision specimens (r2 = 0.30, P = 0.01), the pathologic T stage was underestimated on CNB in 79% of cases. Furthermore, T substage was underestimated on CNB in 71% of T1 lesions. There was concordance in histologic grade between CNB and excisions in 75% of cases. Among the 20 discordant cases, the grade was higher in the excision than in the CNB in 13 cases and lower in seven. However, all discrepancies were within one grade. None of the 17 cancers with LVI in the excision specimen showed LVI on the CNB. Among 14 cases with an EIC on the excision specimen, only four (29%) were scored as having an EIC on CNB. Conclusion: Histologic type can be accurately determined on CNB in most cases. While there was concordance in histologic grade between CNB and excision in the majority of cases, grade was discordant in a substantial minority (25%). The ability to accurately determine tumor size (pa thologic T-stage), LVI, and EIC on CNB is severely limited.														0893-3952

Acta Cytologica		1999	Sept.-Oct., 1999	43	5	801-805	801	805							OBJECTIVE: To study the reasons for interpretive errors in false negative diagnosis of breast carcinoma on fine needle aspiration cytology material. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed only those histologically proved malignant cases where the cytologic material was abnormal and to some extent misinterpreted. RESULTS: There were four lobular carcinomas and one each case of in situ, infiltrating duct, medullary and tubular carcinoma. Smears of lobular carcinomas were hypocellular overall, and the cells showed minimal nuclear pleomorphism. In situ, medullary an tubular carcinoma were associated with fibrocystic changes. The presence of bipolar cells and stromal fragments was misleading in cases of infiltrating duct carcinoma. CONCLUSION: The presence of associated fibrocystic disease may be a misleading factor since it may mask a malignancy. Hypocellularity and relatively nuclear monomorphism were the most common reasons for failure to diagnose malignant breast lesions. Careful attention should be paid to extreme nuclear monomorphism and absence of naked bipolar cells. A cytologically atypical or suspicious diagnosis together with radiologic suspicion should suggest a diagnosis of malignancy.														0001-5547		10.1159/000331293

To reveal whether the status of chromosome 16 corresponds to the histology of breast carcinomas, we examined the signal number of 16cen, 16q breakpoints and 1;16 fusions in the interphase nuclei of 185 breast carcinomas using fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect the loci D16Z2 (16cen), D16Z3 (16q11), D16S154 (16q24) and D1Z1 (1q12). A 16q loss associated with a proximal or distal breakage was identified as a discrepancy between the modal signal counts of the D16Z2, D16Z3 and D16S154 loci in each tumor. Clonal 16cen aneusomy, proximal breakages, distal breakages and l;16 fusion were detected in 62%, 35%, 34% and 38% of the carcinomas respectively. Each of these alterations correlated with the histology of both non-invasive and invasive carcinomas; 16cen aneusomy was more frequent in carcinomas of high histologic grade, proximal breakage was more frequent in invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) of the strand or solid types and in grade-2 and -3 carcinomas, and distal breakage was more frequent in tubular/cribriform type IDCs and grade-1 carcinomas. 1;16 fusion correlated with the tubular/cribriform type of non-invasive or invasive carcinomas and invasive lobular carcinomas. Proximal breakage correlated with 16cen aneusomy, whereas the distal breakage correlated with 16cen disomy. These structural and numerical chromosome alterations appeared to occur in association with each other, and their specific combinations appeared to be involved in the establishment of morphological variety among breast carcinomas.														0020-7136		10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990820)84:4<381::AID-IJC9>3.0.CO;2-Y

Germline mutations of this gene have been identified recently in several gastric cancer families. We analyzed seven patients with a family history of the disease who had diffuse type gastric cancer diagnosed before the age of 45 for germline mutations in CDH1, the gene encoding the E-cadherin protein. We identified a frameshift mutation in exon 3 in one patient with a strong family history of gastric cancer. The same germline mutation was found in the patient's mother, who had metachronous development of lobular breast and diffuse type gastric carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry for E-cadherin protein expression revealed an abnormal staining pattern in both of these tumors, suggesting complete inactivation of the cell adhesion molecule. Thus, our finding suggests that besides diffuse type gastric cancer, lobular breast carcinomas may be associated with germline CDH1 mutations.

Our objective was to document the ultrasound appearances of pure invasive lobular carcinoma, to determine whether there were any specific features when compared to similar cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, and to compare the sensitivity of ultrasound with mammography in the diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma. We report on 23 cases of invasive lobular carcinoma who were matched for age and presentation with cases of invasive ductal carcinoma. High frequency ultrasound detected lesions in 22 cases of invasive lobular carcinoma and all had features highly suggestive of malignancy. Twenty-one of 23 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma also had malignant features. At mammography, six cases of invasive lobular carcinoma were not detected. Ultrasound is as specific for identifying invasive lobular carcinoma as it is for invasive ductal carcinoma. Ultrasoundwas more sensitive than mammography for diagnosing invasive lobular carcinoma.														0960-9776		10.1054/brst.1999.0042

JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association)		1999	June 9, 1999	281	22	2091-2097	2091	2097							Context Long-term, postmenopausal use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) appears to increase breast cancer risk. Whether the effect of HRT use on risk of breast cancer varies among histological types of invasive carcinoma is unknown. Objective To determine associations between HRT use and risk of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive carcinoma with favorable histology, and invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma. Design Prospective cohort study whose participants were followed up continuously for 11 years from January 1986 to December 1996. Setting and Participants Iowa Women's Health Study, a population-based random sample of postmenopausal women aged 55 to 69 years in 1986. A total of 1520 incident breast cancer cases occurred in the at-risk cohort of 37 105 women. Main Outcome Measures Multivariate-adjusted relative risk (RR) of tumor-specific breast cancers associated with duration of ever, current, or past HRT use. Results Duration of ever HRT use was associated with risk of invasive carcinoma with a favorable histology, with an RR of 1.81 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-3.07) for those who used HRT 5 or fewer years vs an RR of 2.65 (95% CI, 1.34-5.23) for those who used HRT for more than 5 years (P for trend = .005) after adjustment for age and other breast cancer risk factors. There was no association between ever HRT use and the incidence of DCIS or invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma. Among current hormone users, after adjusting for age and other breast cancer risk factors, the RRs (95% CIs) of invasive carcinoma with a favorable histology were 4.42 (2.00-9.76) and 2.63 (1.18-5.89) for 5 or fewer years of use and for more than 5 years of use, respectively. Risk of invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma was associated with current use (ltoreq5 years) of HRT with an RR of 1.38 (95% CI, 1.03-1.85). Conclusions Exposure to HRT was associated most strongly with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer with a favorable prognosis. These data add important clinical information for assessing the risks and benefits of HRT use.														0098-7484		10.1001/jama.281.22.2091

On the basis of pathology and the World Health Organization classification of breast tumors, each case was assigned to one of two main histologic types: invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) or invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Invasive lobular carcinoma was further separated into classic and variant types by employing previously published criteria. Twenty-one cases of ILC (5.8%) were diagnosed, which is more than in most previous Japanese studies. Unilateral multicentric breast carcinoma was detected in 9.5% of ILC and 16.1% of IDC (the difference was found not significant). Microscopically, ILC tumors were found to be, on average, larger than IDC. Patients with classic type ILC tended to be younger than those with variant type or IDC. Estrogen receptor expression was found more frequently in variant type ILC than in classic type. These results suggest that the incidence of invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast in Japanese women is low and that unilateral multicentricity is not significantly higher in ILC than in IDC.														1320-5463		10.1111/j.1440-1827.1998.tb03917.x

American Journal of Pathology		1998	Jan., 1998	152	1	75-82	75	82							Several studies have reported loss or alteration of expression of E-cadherin in breast cancer and more recently changes in levels of expression of the catenins. We used immunofluorescence to examine E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and p120ctn (formerly p120CAS) expression in 91 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma. As expected, all four proteins co-localize to the junctional regions of the cells. Although nuclear localization has been described for beta-catenin in colonic polyps, no examples were found in these breast cancer cases. We found that, although alteration is common in the catenins and E-cadherin, complete loss, as exemplified by E-cadherin in lobular carcinoma (where E-cadherin is frequently mutated), is rarely seen. In contrast, the catenin-related protein p120ctn shows an expression pattern that is significantly unrelated to the other catenins (or E-cadherin), including complete loss of expression in approximately 10% of the cases. No statistically significant correlations with traditional prognostic indicators were observed with any of these proteins. We conclude 1) that expression of E-cadherin and a and beta-catenin are generally retained at the membrane although frequently reduced or altered, 2) that complete loss of p120ctn expression is seen in approximately 100/o of the cases, and 3) that there is a significant correlation in the expression of E-cadherin and the catenins but no correlation between these molecules and p120ctn, suggesting an absence of coordinate regulation.														0002-9440

Archives d'Anatomie et de Cytologie Patholoqiques Clinical and Experimental Pathology		1998		46	4	251-256	251	256							Diagnostic difficulties can arise during the cytologic diagnosis of almost all types of breast lesions. "True" difficulties, which are discussed herein, should be differentiated from difficulties due to faulty technique. The frequency of diagnostic difficulties varies across lesions: the proportion of "suspicious" specimens is 4% in adenofibroma, 5 to 7% in cancer, and 17% in epithelial duct hyperplasia, and the false-negative rate in cancer is 3 to 5%. Many difficulties can be overcome by a good knowledge of breast cytopathology. Others are insuperable and should remain so to avoid diagnostic mistakes. In these cases, which should be considered "suspicious", the clearly written documented report should request a histological study. The distinction between duct carcinoma and lobular carcinoma remains difficult, and that between invasive carcinoma and intraductal carcinoma requires a histologic study.

David									Journal of Pathology		1998	Jan., 1998	184	1	37-43	37	43							Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) has been proposed as a cellular mechanism for tumour suppression and there is experimental evidence in support of this. If aberrant GJIC contributes to the formation of human breast tumours, one might expect that the connexins (gap junction proteins) expressed by epithelial cells in normal human breast would be down-regulated in tumour epithelial cells, or that tumour cells might show aberrant expression of other connexin family members. This study examines the immunocytochemical expression of connexins 26 (Cx26) and 43 (Cx43) in normal human breast, 11 benign breast lesions, two special-type carcinomas, and 27 invasive carcinomas of no special histological type (NST). Cx26 generally was not expressed at detectable levels in normal human breast, but punctate Cx43 immunostaining of the myoepithelial cells was found. Cx43 staining of the myoepithelium was also a feature of the benign lesions and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In general, the epithelial cells of benign lesions failed to stain for either connexin. Similarly, a lobular carcinoma did not express Cx26 or Cx43, but there was punctate Cx43 in the epithelial cells of a mucoid carcinoma. Cx26 was up-regulated in the carcinoma cells of 15 of the 27 invasive NST carcinomas, although the staining was usually cytoplasmic and heterogeneous. Cx43 was expressed by stromal cells,, possibly myofibroblasts, in all NST carcinomas. Furthermore, there was heterogeneous Cx43 expression in the carcinoma cells of 14 of the 27 NST carcinomas and the staining was often intercellular and punctate, characteristic of functional connexins. Up-regulation of Cx26 and/or Cx43 in the carcinoma cells of over two-thirds of invasive lesions of NST is not necessarily inconsistent with a tumour suppressor role for GJIC. However, the role of gap junctions in the formation and progression of solid human tumours is likely to be more complex than indicated from experimental systems.

These results are based on the evaluation of heterogeneous groups, without taking clinical differences into account. The aim of this clinical study is to compare metastatic patterns of matched ductal and lobular carcinomas. One hundred eighty-eight lobular carcinomas were matched with 188 ductal carcinomas who showed identical ages, menopausal status, TNM, and dates of treatment. Hepatic, lung and brain metastases are more frequent in ductal carcinoma. Metastases to the gastrointestinal system, gynecologic organs, and peritoneum are more characteristic of lobular carcinoma. Life table analysis of overall and disease free survival shows no significant differences. The metastatic patterns of ductal and lobular carcinomas are different, and physicians should.be aware that the classical staging of the breast cancer is not fit to lobular carcinoma. Could we define patients presenting high metastatic risks? Could we use CA. 125, sonography, laparoscopy in the staging? Should we change the whole therapeutic approach of lobular carcinoma?														0007-4551																				
J	BCI:BCI199800050157	9496257			The localization of the insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR-1) in benign and malignant breast tissue		Happerfield, Lisa C.; Miles, David W.; Barnes, Diana M.; Thomsen, Lindy L.; Smith, Paul; Hanby, Andrew M.									Journal of Pathology		1997	Dec., 1997	183	4	412-417	412	417							Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) play an important role in normal cellular growth and development and have been implicated in the regulation of tumour growth. Two receptors are recognized, IGFR-1 and IGFR-2, of which one, IGFR-1, is a transmembrane heterodimer structurally similar to the insulin receptor. Studies using ligand-binding assays have suggested that the proportion of human breast carcinomas expressing IGFR-1 varies between 39 and 93 per cent and all suggest a lower level of IGFR-1 expression in benign mammary epithelia. As there is this variation between studies and since no study appears to have examined the immunohistochemical localization of IGFR-1 within breast tissue, a series of 79 infiltrating ductal carcinomas, 11 infiltrating lobular carcinomas, three cases of pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), seven fibroadenomas, and eight normal breast specimens have been studied utilizing the monoclonal antibody alphaIR3. IGFR-1 localized to the epithelial component of 90 per cent of the carcinomas, with only cytoplasmic (21 per cent), only membrane (5 per cent), or a mixture of both cytoplasmic and membrane (64 per cent) staining patterns. In some tumours, (P=0.0009). There was a significant correlation between the level of IGFR-1 immunostaining with both oestrogen receptor (P<0.001) and progesterone receptor (P=0.0018) positivity within the malignant group. All normal mammary epithelium showed strong labelling, which was often at an intensity matching that, of the most strongly labelled carcinoma and occasionally visualized as basolateral staining of the luminal cells. Weak to moderate staining of endothelial cells was also) observed. It is concluded that IGFR-1 immunoreactivity is found in the majority of breast carcinomas, where it correlates most closely with oestrogen receptor status. The high intensity labelling of normal cells seen in this study contrasts with the low levels inferred from ligand-binding-based techniques and emphasizes the importance of the morphological approach in the investigation of novel-molecules.														0022-3417

The type of tumor proliferation and the absence of microcalcifications within the invasive tissue led to 15% of false negative responses in the mammographic analysis. Ultrasonography disclosed only 12% of false negatives. Sonographic appearance, especially fine needle aspirations or microbiopsy under ultrasonographic control, allows modification of mammographic and clinical diagnosis errors.

A 17% recurrence rate and a 9% metastasis rate have been reported. Fifteen formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival cases were analyzed. Ploidy and proliferative activity were evaluated with flow cytometric analysis. Demonstration of an abnormal p53 gene product and proliferative cell nuclear antigen analyses were also performed with routine immunohistochemical procedures. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate these parameters and determine if a correlation existed. Flow cytometry was performed on 10 cases; 3 showed an aneuploid cell line (mean, S-phase diploid tumor cells 5.9%; S-phase aneuploid 26.7%). Products of a mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been noted to accumulate in salivary gland tumors, both benign and malignant. Qualitative assessment revealed p53 positive staining in 4 of 15 tumors; positive cells comprised 5% to 10% of the tumor. The percentage of tumor cells positive for proliferative cell nuclear antigen staining ranged from 0.5% to 70%. There was no correlation between proliferative activity as determined by proliferative cell nuclear antigen when compared with results of flow cytometric analysis except for one case that exhibited p53 staining, a 26% proliferative cell nuclear antigen fraction, and a distinct aneuploid cell line.														1079-2104		10.1016/S1079-2104(97)90037-8

Abnormalities for one or both probes were detected in 83/95 samples. Relative 1p36 under-representation was found in 79/95. The clinical relevance of these alterations was studied by comparing the FISH results with several parameters currently used in breast-cancer pathology. Distinct patterns of chromosome 1 abnormalities were found among the histologic types of breast carcinoma. Lobular or mucinous samples showed few or no alterations, whereas most ductal samples had high chromosome 1 polysomy with under-representation of 1p36. In ductal carcinomas, chromosome 1 alterations increased with histologic grade, DNA aneuploidy, loss of bcl-2 and high c-erb B-2 expression. These associations were found to be statistically significant. No correlation between chromosome 1 alterations and nuclear grade, age, size, lymph-node involvement, hormonal receptor presence, proliferation activity or p53 protein expression was detected. These results indicate the utility of this FISH technique for a better definition of the biological characteristics of ductal carcinomas.

Surgery (St Louis)		1993		114	4	637-642	637	642							Background. Many studies have analyzed the metastatic patterns of breast carcinoma. However, very few studies have analyzed the differences in metastatic patterns of lobular versus ductal carcinoma. Methods. By use of our tumor registry, the metastatic sites of all invasive lobular and invasive ductal breast carcinoma cases during an 18-year period (January 1973 to December 1990) were analyzed. Results. There were 2505 cases of invasive lobular and invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Lobular carcinoma accounted for 359 (14%) and ductal carcinoma for 2246 (86%) of the cases. The percentage of patients with regional lymph node metastasis at diagnosis was not significantly different between the two groups. The rates of metastasis to all lymph nodes, liver, and central nervous system were not significantly different. However, the rates of metastasis to the gastrointestinal system (4.5% vs 0.2%), gynecologic organs (4.5% vs 0.8%), peritoneum-retroperitoneum (3.7% us 0.6%), adrenal glands (0.6% vs 0%), bone-marrow (21.2% us 14.4%), and lung-pleura (2.5% vs 10.2%) were significantly different (p lt 0.05). Conclusions. The metastatic patterns of lobular and ductal carcinoma of the breast are different, with gastrointestinal system, gynecologic organ, and peritoneum-retroperitoneum metastases markedly more prevalent in lobular carcinoma. Physicians should be aware of these different metastatic patterns of lobular and ductal carcinoma of the breast.														0039-6060

The appearance of BM and MEC changes are summarized as follows: (1) An intact pattern was seen in lobular hyperplasia, benign tumors, intraductual carcinoma and lobular carcinoma in situ; (2) disruptive patterns were seen in carcinoma with early microinvasion locally; (3) patterns of fragmentation or absences were seen in invasive carcinomas. Quantitative analyses of the percentage of collagen IV length in ductal circumference examined showed 98%, 89%, and < 46% in above groups respectively. A negative relationship between the aneuploidic DNA content and changes in BM integrity was demonstrated in ductal carcinoma (r = -0.914, P < 0.05). These results suggest the distribution patterns of BM and MEC after staining with immunohistochemical techniques are valuable markers for distinguishing breast carcinoma invasion, especially local invasion in early stages.														0257-8131

Among these 30 patients, intraductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) outnumbers lobular carcinoma-in-situ (LCIS) by 9-fold. They are mostly symptomatic - 87% present as breast lumps and/or nipple discharge, with 52% of lumps exceeding 2 cm size. Three patients were detected by screening mammography and it is expected that more breast carcinoma-in-situ will be detected through mammographic screening. Two-thirds of the patients had mastectomy while the rest had lesser procedures. The different surgical procedures and adjuvant therapy instituted for the patients are reflections of the differing opinions regarding optimum therapy for carcinoma-in-situ and the differing rationale for DCIS and LCIS lesions.														0037-5675

Virchows Archiv A Pathological Anatomy and Histopathology		1992		421	4	323-330	323	330							A detailed immunohistochemical study has been carried out on 63 breast lesions with epitheliosis, ductal carcinoma in situ and clinging carcinoma (lobular cancerization), using antibodies directed against keratins 5/14 and 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, vimentin, smooth muscle actin, collagen IV and laminin. The results have shown that epitheliosis on the one hand and ductal in situ and clinging carcinoma on the other are immunohistochemically different epithelial lesions. Epitheliosis appears to be epithelial hyperplasia with keratin 5/14 and keratin 14, 15, 16, 18, 19-positive cells. Compared to epitheliotic cells tumor cells of clinging carcinoma, lobular cancerization and ductal carcinoma in situ expressed only luminal keratins 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 in 85% of the cases studied; whereas in 15% there was a basal keratin expression. From our results we conclude that the clinging carcinoma (lobular cancerization) represents the initial morphological step in the development of ductal carcinoma in situ and thus may be interpreted as a minimal ductal neoplasia. With the immunohistochemical demonstration of basal and luminal keratins it may be possible in individual cases to differentiate between benign and malignant in situ lesions of the breast.														0174-7398

Thirty-one patients with a local recurrence were compared with 31 matched patients without a local recurrence. Morphology and DNA-indices of the local recurrences and their corresponding primary tumours were compared. Ductal carcinoma in situ was present significantly more often in the group with a primary recurring tumor, than in the matched group (P < 0.001), and the same holds for lobular carcinoma (n = 5). Half of the tumors that recurred had macroscopically positive surgical margins compared ot about one-fourth of the matched group. Fifty-six per cent of the DNA-aneuploid stemlines in cases with local recurrence were present in the corresponding primary tumor as well (confidence limits 45%-75%), an indication that the majority local recurrences are true recurrences and not independently developed tumors. The lack of similarlity of DNA stemline between some primary DNA-aneuploid tumors and their local recurrences indicates that these tumors had developed independently. The percentage of DNA-aneuploid cases in the group with local recurrence (89%) did not differ significantly from that in the matched group (70%). However, the findings suggest a selective recurrence of DNA-diploid stemlines. This might indicate increased resistance of DNA-diploid tumour cells to radiotherapy as compared with the resistance level in DNA-aneuploid cells.														0007-0920		10.1038/bjc.1991.257

The growth fractions determined in areas of central and peripheral tumor were the same. Mucinous and lobular carcinoma showed lower Ki-67 activity than ductal carcinomas. When ductal carcinomas were subdivided according to their dominant growth pattern, the carcinomas with a solid or comedo growth pattern showed the highest proliferative activity. These results largely confirm data from previous cell kinetic studies on the incorporation of radioactively labelled thymidine. A correlation between the growth fraction determined by Ki-67 in fine needle aspiration smears and cryostat sections of corresponding tumors was shown, implying that the immunostaining of cytological smears gives a reliable impression of the growth fraction of a tumor and may therefore be used in prospective studies.														0021-9746		10.1136/jcp.44.3.208

This was compared to the localization of immunoreactive carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as demonstrated by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. In frozen sections, CEA was localized in normal surface epithelium of the stomach and colon where NCA was only weakly detected. Type 1 and type 2-like pneumocytes were positive for NCA, while CEA was localized only in type 2-like pneumocytes. CEA and NCA were both demonstrated in ductal cells of frozen pancreatobiliary and mammary tissues. The antigenicity of CEA and NCA in normal tissues was significantly lost after paraffin embedding as compared to frozen sections. NCA was consistently demonstrated in eccrine sweat glands embedded in paraffin. In various tumor tissues, CEA and NCA were colocalized and expression increased sufficiently to be detected in paraffin sections. Adenocarcinomas of the stomach and colon and cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas, as well as neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung and thyroid, showed a CEA predominance over NCA. In ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and breast and in cholangiocarcinoma, NCA reactivity was greater than CEA. Keratinizing foci of most squamous cell carcinomas of mucosal origin and some adenocarcinomas equally expressed both. Hepatocellular carcinoma, lobular mammary carcinoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma were positive only with unabsorbed polyclonal antibody which widely recognizes CEA-related substances. Renal cell carcinoma, prostatic adenocarcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, anaplastic carcinomas, choriocarinoma and basal cell carcinomas showed little or no immunoreactivity. Hence the relative ratio of CEA/NCA expression in tumors was dependent on the tissue of origin and histologic type. The cytoplasmic granular staining of NCA in cancer cells was a noteworthy difference from the plasma membrane-associated localization of CEA.														0001-6632

Elevated levels of the four biomarkers in breast carcinoma were significant when compared with controls (p < 0.001). Fucose levels were most sensitive (71.8%), while TSA levels were most specific (64.3%) for breast carcinoma. Sensitivity and specificity were 100% when combinations of LSA with fucose and TSA with HSAP were studied respectively. LSA was significantly elevated in infiltrating duct carcinoma patients compared with lobular carcinoma (p < 0.001). TSA, HSAP and fucose also had lower mean values in lobular carcinoma as compared to infiltrating duct carcinoma. Increase in the levels of LSA and HSAP after surgical removal of the tumor in breast carcinoma occurred prior to the clinical evidence of the recurrence.

Five of the six lesions were Stage I pathologically without evidence of axillary nodal involvement. It is recommended that female patients with Hodgkin's disease who have received mantle irradiation as part of the therapy for their Hodgkin's disease and who are observed for 10 or more years after completion of mantle irradiation be considered at risk for the development of breast cancer. Such patients should be monitored appropriately by routine bilateral mammograms to increase the early detection of early stage lesions.														0008-543X		10.1002/1097-0142(19900115)65:2<221::AID-CNCR2820650207>3.0.CO;2-9

In breast carcinoma patients, we have observed significant increase in the levels of the three markers compared with the controls (P < 0.001) and in MP and hexoses compared to the patients with benign breast diseases (P < 0.001). LASA and hexoses levels were significantly higher in benign breast diseases with respect to controls (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the markers individually and in combination. MP were most sensitive (71.8%) and specific (71.4%). Both sensitivity and specificity were increased when combinations of the markers were studied. Combination of MP with LASA was most sensitive (97.4%) while the combination of MP and hexoses was most specific (92.9%). LASA was significantly elevated in infiltrating duct carcinoma compared to lobular carcinoma (P < 0.001). MP and hexoses also showed higher mean value in infiltrating duct carcinoma than lobular carcinoma. The present study suggests that the combination of the markers investigated might be useful for diagnosis and classification of breast carcinoma.														0304-3835		10.1016/0304-3835(90)90103-5

All these patients were post-menopausal at the time of their presentation. These were a heterogeneous group of well-differentiated cellular breast carcinomas, comprising cases of invasive duct carcinoma with extensive tubular differentiation or with focal argyrophilia, tubulolobular carcinoma, lobular carcinoma of mixed type containing abundant intracytoplasmic lumina, papillary carcinoma and type B colloid carcinoma. There was very little tumour necrosis. Nodal metastasis, tumour size and host inflammatory response did not appear to show any relationship with oestrogen receptor status. The patients, apart from two who died from other causes, remain alive (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.01). In contrast, 17 randomly selected cases of oestrogen receptor negative breast cancer in the same study period were focally necrotic, poorly-differentiated invasive duct carcinomas. Six patients died from metastatis disease, seven were alive and well, one was alive with metastic disease, one was lost to follow-up and two died from diseases unrelated to breast cancer.														0309-0167

The specificity of such antibioties was investigated with ELISA and Western blotting techniques. Five cases of infiltrating ductal carcinomas were found positive with the immune serum anti-reverse transcriptase of Moloney murine leukemia virus on 28 studied infiltrating ductal carcinomas, 2 infiltrating lobular carcinomas and 2 fibroadenomas.														0258-851X

Monoclonal antibodies were applied to cryosections by the avidin-biotin-complex method; selected samples were studied by double immunofluorescence, and by Western blot analysis. In adult resting and aging breasts, tenascin immunoreactivity was noted in the periductal and periacinar stromal regions as thin irregular bands; in the lactating breast, broader periductal bands were observed. In these samples, laminin immunoreactivity was a single continuous line around ducts, acini, and vessels. In fetal breasts, tenascin appeared as thick periductal bands, whereas laminin remained as a delicate single line. In FCD, tenascin increased around ducts showing hyperplasia, papillomas and apocrine metaplasia, whereas laminin retained its delicate linear pattern. Similar patterns were seen in fibroadenomas and cystosarcoma phylloides with variable tenascin reactivity in the stroma beyond the ducts. Tenascin immunoreactivity was markedly increased around ducts containing in situ carcinoma appearing as broad bands, whereas that of laminin showed a linear, frequently discontinuous appearance. Prominent stromal tenascin immunoreactivity was seen in infiltering ductal and lobular carcinomas, whereas laminin was virtually absent save for scattered lines. The abundance of tenascin in the carcinomatous stroma of tenascin with molecular weights 250,000 and 180,000 were shown in ductal and lobular carcinomas as well as in normal breast. Tenascin immunoreactivity was noted in the periepithelial stromal regions of adult resting and aging breast ducts and acini. The amount of tenascin was moderately enhanced in certain physiologic conditions (fetal growth, gestation), as well as hyperplasias, dysplasias (fibrocystic disease) and benign tumors, whereas it was markedly enhanced in intraductal and infiltrating carcinomas. During fetal mammary development, adult physiologic and pathologic hyperplasias, and in carcinomas, the increasing tenascin reactivity contrasted with the stable or decreasing laminin reactivity.														0023-6837

A total of 868 cases were identified in the Wilford Hall Tumor Registry; overall 5-year and 10-year survivals were 63% and 39%, respectively. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma represented the principal histologic category. The other predominant variants included invasive lobular carcinoma, lobular carcinoma in situ, and ductal carcinoma in situ. Until recently, most of these patients (90%) had modified radical mastectomy as their definitive surgical therapy, with chemotherapy reserved primarily for patients with advanced disease.

Of 243 patients coded, 226 were available for review by a panel of three pathologists. In 149 cases the diagnosis of in situ disease was confirmed. One hundred and eight patients had 109 ductal carcinomas in situ, 38 patients had lobular carcinomas in situ, with 3 patients having both. A multitude of treatments was used, ranging from local excision to radical mastectomy. Survival at a mean of 6 years follow-up was equal in all groups, with only two patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ dying from clinically suspected systemic disease. In patients treated by local excision, ipsilateral cancers were seen in 12% of ductal carcinoma in situ patients who had local excision and 13% of patients with lobular carcinoma in situ. Contralateral metachronous invasive cancers were seen in 6% of ductal carcinoma in situ patients and 3% of lobular carcinoma in situ patients. No lymph node involvement was seen in any of these patients, either with prophylactic dissection or in follow-up. The conclusion reached was that both in situ lesions are similar in their clinical course. Lymph node dissection is not necessary. Pathologic review is critical for accurate studies, with a change in diagnosis of 36% of diagnoses. Treatment does not appear to affect prognosis. The most appropriate treatment needs to be determined in prospective randomized trials.														0003-4932		10.1097/00000658-198911000-00014

The monoclonal antibody Y13 259 has been used for the ras p21, the monoclonal antibody Myc1-9E10 for the c-myc p62 and the polyclonal antibody pAb1 (from Triton Bioscience Inc.) for the c-erbB-2 p185 oncoproteins. The following conclusions can be drawn from the analysis: Of the 100 breast carcinoma cases studied only 14 did not express any of the three oncogenes. The remaining 86 were positive for one or more of the three oncoproteins. Ductal carcinomas expressed oncoproteins in 92% of the cases (67/73), whereas lobular carcinomas expressed them in 70% of the cases (19/27). The most frequently expressed was c-myc p62 in 70% of cases followed by ras p21, 55% and c-erbB-2, 35%. Elevated expression of ras, myc or erbB-2 oncogenes did not correlate with the presence of metastasis in auxiliary lymph nodes, the numbers of infiltrated lymph nodes the grade of the tumor or hormone status. However, there appears to be a correlation between increased ras staining intensity and patient's age, below 50 years.				Field, John/0000-0003-3951-6365										0250-7005

Of these, 1,658 tumours were invasive. Sufficient histological material existed for 1,666 malignant tumours to make it possible to classify them according to the criteria published by the WHO. The most frequent histological type was Ductal carcinoma: 1,064 neoplasms, or 64%. Second in frequency was Lobular carcinoma: 174 neoplasms, or 10%; third was Mucinous carcinoma: 115 neoplasms, or 7%; and fourth in frequency was Medullary carcinoma: 69 neoplasms, or 4%. The incidence of carcinoma of the breast increased by 74% from 37.0 per 100,000 per annum in 1955 - 59 to 64.4 per 100,000 in 1980 - 84. This increase in incidence affected all morphological types, but Lobular and Mucinous more than Ductal and Medullary. The survival times have improved with time. Unilateral tumours were 710 in right and 837 in the left breast. Both breasts were involved 167 times (106 patients), and in 6 patients the side was not recorded. A second primary was more likely to develop when the first one was in the right breast. This study of malignant tumours of the breast is the tenth in a series of investigations into histological classification of tumours occurring in Iceland.														0903-4641		10.1111/j.1699-0463.1988.tb05296.x

Four women had radial scars on the ipsilateral side in the breast tissue available from the primary surgical procedure or at autopsy. One woman had an invasive breast cancer with morphologic features compatible with but not diagnostic of transition from a radial scar. Of the six radial scars with carcinoma in situ occurring in three women, three were of ductal and three of lobular type. In the remaining cases only radial scars with a benign appearance were found except for two with atypical hyperplasia. The frequency of radial scars was significantly higher in women with fibrocystic disease (55%) compared to women without (24%). Contralateral primary invasive and in situ breast cancer occurred in 68%. No difference in the frequency of radial scars in women with and without breast cancer was found and radial scars were not associated with any specific type of breast cancer. Our findings do not indicate a higher malignant potential of radial scars than of fibrocystic disease. It is suggested that only radial scars containing high-risk epithelial changes such as atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma in situ are associated with an increased risk of subsequent breast cancer development.														0008-543X		10.1002/1097-0142(19870301)59:5<1019::AID-CNCR2820590528>3.0.CO;2-N

Based on the method of analysis (dextran-coated charcoal) and criteria for a positive result used for this survey, 80 percent of the primary tumours were ER-positive and 56 percent were PR-positive. In those cases where both assays were performed, 47.4 percent were ER-positive, PR-positive; 19.8 percent were ER-positive, PR-negative; 6.2 percent were ER-negative, PR-positive; and 26.6 percent were ER-negative, PR-negative. The mean concentration of ER increased with the advancing age of the patient; essentially the same relationship was observed for PR. The concentration of ER and PR was not directly dependent upon the degree of cellularity of the tumor. Lobular carcinoma and the mixed types containing ductal and lobular elements had the highest frequency of being positive for both steroid receptors, while medullary and papillary carcinomas were lowest. Three hundred and twenty-two cases had follow-up studies and were examined on the basis of the available information in the files of St. Joseph's Hospital Tumor Registry. A higher survival rate in patients with both ER and PR positivity became evident. In a community hospital setting, our data confirm the usefulness of estrogen and progesterone receptor assays in decisions of clinical management and considerations of prognosis in patients with mammary carcinoma.														0091-7370

The thymidine labeling index (TLI) was significantly lower in cribriform-paillary intraductal carcinoma (median 1.30%, geometric mean 1.18%, mean 1.83 .+-. 0.45%) and lobular carcinoma in situ (median 1.43%, geometric mean 1.12%, mean 1.63 .+-. 0.46%) than in comedo intraductal carcinoma (median 4.40%, geometric mean 3.74%, mean 5.15 .+-. 0.86%). The results for solid intraductal carcinoma, which is a less well defined and more heterogeneous entity, were intermediate (median 2.45%, geometric mean 2.40%, mean 3.32 .+-. 0.80%). When invasive carcinoma was also available for kinetic study, the TLI of in situ and invasive components were usually similar (r = 0.66). The data indicate that the TLI usually does not change during the transition from in situ to invasive carcinoma. Cribriform-papillary intraduct carcinoma is a slowly proliferating entity that gives rise to slowly proliferating invasive carcinomas with relatively high levels of estrogen and progesterone receptors. Lobular carcinoma in situ similarly has low proliferative rates and gives rise to slowly proliferating invasive carcinomas. Intraductal comedocarcinoma has relatively high proliferative rates and gives rise to invasive carcinomas with high proliferative rates that often are receptor-negative. Nine of the 11 in situ carcinomas that were associated with invasive tumor and subsequent local recurrence or metastasis had TLIs above the median, and seven were comedo type with high TLIs. Our observations from thymidine labeling are consistent with a viewpoint regarding cribriform-papillary intraductal carcinoma as relatively bland, and comedo intraductal carcinoma as a distinctly more dangerous entity. Solid intraductal carcinoma seems to resemble cribriform-papillary more closely than comedo intraductal carcinoma.														0167-6806		10.1007/BF01806247

Lobular and medullary carcinomas were infrequent. About 33% of the women had marked productive fibrosis, based on the UICC [International Union Against Cancer] code type. Both rough margin and productive fibrosis of the cancer increased with age of the patients. Most of accompanying hyperplastic lesions decreased with age. The difference was significant for cystic formation between 10-yr age groups of 45-54 and 55-64 (.chi.2 = 6.61, P < 0.02). Hormone receptors of 115 of the cases were independently measured and characterized according to histologic patterns manifesting host reaction (stromal cell infiltration and lymph node histiocytosis). Positive estrogen receptors were more frequent among ductal carcinomas with slight or no cellular reaction than those with extensive cellular reaction. The same pattern was also present for progesterone and androgen receptors. The extent of sinus histiocytosis in lymph nodes without metastasis was also inversely correlated with the presence of these hormone receptors.

Tumors consisted in 158 invasive ductal carcinomas, 11 invasive lobular carcinomas and 11 special forms. The benign environment was divided in 3 groups: no epithelial lesion (1/5 cases), mastose simple (3/5) (elementary lesions more or less associated, exceptionaly isolated, diffuse or focal), the last, 1/5, corresponded to a mastose complex defined as the significant association of the same elementary lesions (minimum 3-4), diffuse, with some degree of dysplasia and always an intraductal hyperplasia, of any type. The mastose complex group (particularly intraductal hyperplasia) is discussed in relation to cancer, a lobular origin for precancerous lesions, and individualization of epidemiological factors in relations to development of malignant tumors.														0242-6498

Pregnancy-specific .beta.-1 glycoprotein (SP-1), a recently described placental protein, was detected both in the serum and tumors of patients with breast carcinoma. The significance of SP-1 in breast carcinoma was assessed by staining 139 cases of primary breast carcinoma for SP-1 using the immunoperoxidase technique. Overall, 55 (40%) of breast cancers were positive for SP-1; focal positivity was also noted in normal breast epithelium and fibrocystic disease. Both intraductal (32%) and infiltrating duct (43%) carcinomas were more often positive than either in situ (5%) or infiltrating (26%) lobular carcinomas. SP-1 positivity in tumors of infiltrating duct morphology < 3 cm in diameter, correlated highly (P < 0.01) with the presence of axillary lymph node metastases. The presence of SP-1 in normal breast epithelium and fibrocystic disease and the low rate of positivity in lobular carcinoma casts doubt on the usefulness of SP-1 as a tumor marker. Immunopositivity for SP-1 in small infiltrating duct carcinomas may be an indicator of poor prognosis.														0008-543X		10.1002/1097-0142(19841001)54:7<1392::AID-CNCR2820540727>3.0.CO;2-M

The group of invasive ductal carcinomas, including 78 cases, was subclassified in not otherwise specified (53 cases), with intraductal (19 cases), and with tubular component (6 cases). The other cancer histotypes were invasive lobular carcinoma (9 cases), medullary carcinoma (7 cases), mucinous carcinoma (4 cases), and papillary carcinoma (2 cases). The pattern of the mammary glandular tree was atrophic (67 cases) or adenosic, i.e., rich in mammary lobules (33 cases), but mammary lobules (normal, paranormal, atypical, or persistent in otherwise atrophic breasts) were present in 83% of the cases. A significant prevalence of not otherwise specified cancer (.chi.2 = 10.20; P < 0.01) was found in atrophic breasts (64%) and, even more, in breasts without lobules (76%). By contrast, intraductal component, tubular component, invasive lobular, and medullay cancers were, with two single exceptions, only in breasts with lobules, and this concentration was also significant (.chi.2 = 7.26; P < 0.01). Breast cancer histotype is influenced by, or related to, the surrounding microenvironment, i.e., the pattern of the mammary glandular tree.														0252-1172

Portions of tumor of .apprx. 1 mm3 were cultured in buffered Medium 199 for 48 h with or without addition of digoxin at concentratoins from 1-2 ng/ml to 10-20 .mu.g/ml of culture medium. Measurement of DNA synthesis by [3H]-thymidine incorporation, DNA analysis and histological examination showed that 5 biopsy specimens demonstrated epithelial cell survival in culture. These cultures were significantly (P < 0.001) affected by digoxin at concentrations > 10-20 ng/ml, with suppression of [3H]-thymidine incorporation and reduced epithelial cell viability. Parallel studies on 5 biopsy specimens of DMBA[dimethylbenzanthracene]-induced rat mammary carcinomas showed no effects of digoxin up to 10 .mu.g/ml of culture medium. These studies indicate the possibility of this class of drug being of use in growth suppression of breast tumors.

Breasts were grossly divided into 3 basic types: solid, when showing a sizable cone of solid tissue (mammary tissue and fibrous stroma), fatty when almost completely replaced by fat, and intermediary types Ia and Ib. These types apparently represent stages of an evolutionary process involving the anatomical structure of the breast during life. Mammary alterations gradually lead to lobular atrophy. Generalized lobular atrophy characterizes mainly fatty breasts. Lesions of fibrocystic disease are frequent in breasts of all types. In all 3 types of breast carcinomas were more frequently located in the outer portion of the breast. Rare locations of carcinomas are associated with the type of breast: a central location is more frequent in fatty, an inner location in intermediary and a diffuse in solid breasts. In fatty breasts irregular tumors are common, while in solid breasts tumors without clear borders appear to develop. Multicentric carcinomas were much more frequent in solid breasts than in the other types of breasts. Most multicentric carcinomas are accompanied by multicentric carcinoma in situ. Infiltrative lobular and mixed (lobular-ductal) carcinomas are accompanied by lobular carcinoma in situ, lobular cancerization or both. In infiltrative ductal and the special types of carcinomas, the histology of carcinoma in situ differs according to whether or not the infiltrative tumor is single or multicentric. The difference concerns the complete lack of lobular cancerization from cases with single infiltrative tumors.														0344-0338		10.1016/S0344-0338(83)80011-9

From an analysis of the case histories of 36 patients, the diagnosis was difficult in 1/4 of the cancers. This is explained by the high incidence of subclinical and lobular carcinoma in the group. Cancer must be seriously considered as a diagnosis in patients presenting with well-localized breast pain of recent onset. These patients should be followed for at least 1 yr after the onset of the pain before cancer is confidently excluded.																10.1136/bmj.284.6325.1299

RELATIONSHIP OF FAMILY HISTORY TO TUMOR TYPE		ROSEN P P; LESSER M L; SENIE R T; KINNE D W									Cancer		1982		50	1	171-179	171	179							Previous breast carcinoma in at least 1 female relative was reported by 31% of 1024 women treated consecutively for breast carcinoma. Eighty (7.9%) of their mothers had had breast cancer. Maternal breast cancer was significantly (P < 0.006) more frequent among women with medullary carcinoma than those with other tumor types and among those who were pre- or perimenopausal at diagnosis (P < 0.001). Among the 727 patients who had 1 or more sisters, 12% had a sister who had been treated for breast cancer. The highest frequency of carcinoma in at least 1 sister occurred in patients with lobular carcinoma while the medullary carcinoma group had the least number of patients with an affected sister (P < 0.03). Occurrence of breast cancer in a sister was almost twice as common in patients who were postmenopausal at diagnosis (P < 0.005) than in premenopausal patients. When stratified by histologic type, the mean age at diagnosis of the patients did not differ appreciably from the age at diagnosis of their sisters. Detailed analyses of histologic type and other more distant familial relationships were also obtained but were considered to be less reliable because of problems in ascertainment and there were fewer affected relatives. No single histologic type of carcinoma was consistently linked to a disproportionately high or low frequency of carcinoma in all classes of relatives. Studies of family history limited to information available when the patient is first treated may present an incomplete picture of familial aggregation. Further follow-up after diagnosis is needed to obtain a more reliable measure of the extent to which relatives are affected by breast cancer and patterns of family distribution associated with specific tumor types.														0008-543X		10.1002/1097-0142(19820701)50:1<171::AID-CNCR2820500132>3.0.CO;2-M

Median activity was higher in ductal carcinomas than in tumors with lobular components. Activity did not correlate with tumor grade or stage, or the presence or absence of axillary node involvement. Activity, however, correlated with tumor cellularity, lymphocyte infiltration levels, total protein and alkaline phosphatase levels. Variation in peroxidase activity in human breast tumors is at least in part due to lymphocyte infiltration. This contamination of breast tumors with lymphocytes may explain the lack of correlation between estradiol receptor levels and peroxidase activity.														0277-5379		10.1016/0277-5379(82)90113-4

They are separable into 5 with and 9 without intracellular mucin. All the tumors are argyrophil, but none is argentaffin. Four tumors studied ultrastructurally contain dense-core granules. Argyrophil carcinomas represent the endocrine analogs of ductal carcinoma in situ, of invasive ductal carcinoma and probably of lobular carcinoma also. Current views vary between the one that the so-called carcinoid is a rare and totally distinct entity to the view, at the other extreme, that it is a very common variant of conventional breast cancer. An intermediate view is justified: argyrophil carcinomas constitute about 5% of breast carcinomas and some varieties at least have non-argyrophil analogs. Factors influencing the prognosis in individual cases are discussed. Argyrophil carcinomas of the breast form a tumor spectrum with a wide range of morphological and histochemical appearances and a variable prognosis.														0309-0167		10.1111/j.1365-2559.1982.tb02750.x

In non-neoplastic mammary gland all epithelial cells were stained with these antibodies. In pre-invasive and invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas a cell population was observed which was not significantly stained with antibodies to epidermal prekeratin but did strongly react with antibodies to liver cytokeratin D. In the liver, the antibodies to epidermal prekeratin and those directed against liver cytokeratin D strongly decorated bile duct epithelia. Significant staining of the hepatocytes was only achieved with antibodies to liver cytokeratin D. This different staining reaction was maintained in liver tumors of hepatocellular and cholangiocellular origin. Antibodies to vimentin stained mesenchymal cells and tumors of mesenchymal derivation but reacted not significantly with any of the epithelial and carcinoma cells examined. The difference is of practical importance for the discrimination between anaplastic carcinomas and sarcomas of unknown origin. Cytokeratin could also be detected by antibody staining using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique in formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded material of skin, gastrointestinal, respiratory, urinary and genital tract and various glands, liver and kidney. Examples of positive reactions were shown in a squamous cell carcinoma, a basalioma and a pleomorphic adenoma of the parotis. The immunohistochemical analysis of intermediate filament proteins has diagnostic potential in clinical pathology and may help to elucidate histogenesis and differentiation of tumors and possibly also prognosis of tumor growth. Antibodies recognizing different subsets of proteins of the cytokeratin family can be used to distinguish between different types of carcinomas.														0344-0338		10.1016/S0344-0338(82)80109-X

Among 134 patients (35%) with a primary tumor 1.0 cm or less in diameter (group A), 7% had recurrences and 5% died of breast carcinoma. Recurrences were observed in 21% of the 248 women with a tumor 1.1-2.0 cm in diameter (group B) and 15% died of disease. These differences in recurrence and mortality rates were statistically significant. All recurrences were due to infiltrating duct or lobular carcinoma, which accounted for 91% of the 382 carcinomas. Most strongly linked to recurrence was the finding of tumor emboli in lymphatics of the breast. This was found in 23 group B patients and 10 of them (43%) died of disease. No recurrences were observed among the 7 group A patients with lymphatic emboli. Other features associated with a significantly increased risk of recurrence were poorly differentiated carcinoma, marked lymphoid reaction to tumor and menarche before age 12 yr or after age 14 yr. No combination of variables proved to identify a subset of patients with an especially increased or low risk of recurrence. Stage I patients with lymphatic tumor emboli in the breast surrounding a carcinoma 1.1-2.0 cm in diameter have a sufficient risk for recurrence to warrant consideration of adjuvant systemic therapy. A very low risk of recurrence was observed for the following: any tumor 1.0 cm or smaller; and tubular, medullary or colloid carcinoma up to 2.0 cm.														0003-4932		10.1097/00000658-198101000-00003

The crude and age-adjusted incidence rates are seen to be the highest in the Parsi community followed by the Christian, Moselm and Hindu groups. In all the religious groups, an increase in incidence of breast cancer is first seen in the 3rd decade. This is followed by a sharp increase up to the age of 50-54 leading to a slight drop, and then a consistent but slower rise in the older ages. The high risk of developing this cancer in Parsi women as compared with the Christian, Moslem and Hindu experience may be due to a higher proportion of Parsi women remaining unmarried, their higher age at marriage, lower age at 1st pregnancy, broad spacing of pregnancies and fewer numbers of pregnancies. The distribution according to histologic types of breast cancer in India is characterized by a high frequency of infiltrating duct carcinoma. Medullary, lobular and squamous cell carcinoma were typical histological varieties of the older age groups, whereas ductal carcinoma was encountered mostly in premenopausal women.														0022-4790		10.1002/jso.2930180309

A histochemical method of demonstrating ER is presented. The method was employed in the material of 46 cases of breast cancer. Of these, 69.9% were estrogen receptor positive (ER+). More numerous estrogen receptor negative (ER-) cases of carcinoma were found in the group of premenopausal/menopausal women than in the post-menopausal women but the difference was not significant. The distribution of ER+ and ER- carcinomas among the infiltrating ductal carcinomas showed a tendency towards more numerous ER- carcinomas among the least differentiated tumors and 6 of the 7 infiltrating lobular carcinomas were ER+. If ER+ carcinomas are defined as those with a receptor content of > 10 fmol/mg protein and in histochemical investigations as those with > 10% fluorescent cells, frequencies of ER+ and ER- carcinomas were found of those found to be similar in 2 previous histochemical materials and in an extensive material investigated biochemically. Theoretical aspects of histochemical demonstration of estrogen receptors are discussed. Although unexplained conditions still exist concerning the relationship between the receptors demonstrated histochemically and those demonstrated biochemically, histochemical demonstration of estrogen receptors offers a possibility for supplementing biochemical demonstration.														0041-5782

Generally the ER concentrations were lower in the tumors of premenopausal women than in those of postmenopausal women. Three types of cancer with specific morphological features had ER concentrations that differed significantly from the other types of cancer. Medullary and comedocarcinoma had very low and papillary carcinoma very high levels of ER. No obvious trend in ER concentration was found in unspecified ductal carcinoma, colloid carcinoma or lobular carcinoma.

Bilateral noninvasive carcinoma was found in 8 women and 7 biopsies reported as intraductal on frozen section contained invasive carcinoma on paraffin section. Of the remaining 122 biopsies proven to have noninvasive carcinoma on paraffin section, 39 (34%) were reported at frozen section as noninvasive carcinoma, 24 (20%) as atypical and 59 (48%) as benign. Intraductal carcinoma (IDC) was identified more often at frozen section (45%) than was lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS] (19%). Among 41 patients who had bilateral carcinoma with invasive disease in 1 breast, 76% of contralateral noninvasive carcinoma was LCIS. After excisional biopsy, carcinoma was found in 56% of 103 mastectomy specimens, including invasive carcinoma in 6% of breasts with IDC and 4% with LCIS. Residual noninvasive carcinoma was usually of the same type found at biopsy (90% IDC and 88% LCIS) and involved quadrants other than the biopsy site in 33% with IDC and in 80% with LCIS. When the frozen or paraffin section diagnosis of a generous excisional biopsy was noninvasive breast carcinoma, there was a substantial risk that foci of the same type of noninvasive carcinoma were also present in other quadrants. Occult foci of invasive carcinoma were quite infrequent and the risk of axillary metastases was very low. Adequate treatment for noninvasive carcinoma requires elimination of all residual foci of noninvasive disease which can best be accomplished by total mastectomy. To insure removal of the axillary extension of the breast and for staging, in continuity dissection of the lowest axillary lymph nodes is also prudent.														0003-4932		10.1097/00000658-197903000-00021

Elastosis is the main stromal response in infiltrating duct and lobular carcinomas. Medullary carcinoma elicits no significant elastosis but intraductal carcinoma has significant local elastosis. Benign conditions such as fibroadenoma and sclerosing adenosis produced no significant elastosis. The high number of elastic fibers and the high microfibril:elastin ratio indicate that most of the elastic fibers are recently secreted, probably by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. The factors stimulating the increased production of elastic fibers and the prognostic significance of elastosis remain unclear.														0008-543X		10.1002/1097-0142(197708)40:2<700::AID-CNCR2820400217>3.0.CO;2-W

The proportion of tumors with each of these characteristics was positively associated with age at 1st child-birth. Increasing age at 1st birth had a strong positive effect on the incidence risk of tumors with any of these features, but only a small effect on risk of tumors with none. For parous women, the rate of breast cancer with or without linear strands, with or without areas of intraductal cancer and without areas of lobular carcinoma in situ was lower than for nulliparous women. Parity appeared not to reduce the risk of tumors with areas of lobular carcinoma in situ.														0020-7136		10.1002/ijc.2910180602

THERRON									CANCER		1967		20	(3)	363-370	363	370							The phenomenon of single filing in carcinoma of the breast was demonstrated in 140 (3.2%) of 4320 patients seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1943 and 1957. The age of distribution, symptoms and signs, gross pathologic findings and size of the tumors did not show different features from .mammary carcinoma in general. Bilaterality was present in 15 patients (11%), which is a higher rate than in mammary carcinoma in general. Regional lymph nodes were metastatically involved in 51% of the group. Single filing is formed by desmoplastic strands of mostly medium-sized cells followed in frequency by small and large cells. Mitotic figures are rare. Single filing was found in connection with infiltrating or noninfiltrating lobular carcinomas in 21.2% and with areas of intraductal carcinomas in 36%. The prognostic outlook for patients without lymph node involvement in somewhat similar to that of patients having carcinoma of the breast in general; that for patients with positive lymph nodes is poor, with a 9% chance of 10-year survival. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Amhors																10.1002/1097-0142(1967)20:3<363::AID-CNCR2820200304>3.0.CO;2-B

J AMER MED ASS		1967		201	(2)	82-86	82	86							In situ lobular carcinoma is a preinvasive form of breast cancer which if inadequately treated will frequently progress to infiltrative cancer. A follow-up study of 50 patients with in situ lobular carcinoma, treated in most instances by local excision, reveals the following subsequent cumulative risk of infiltration: 8% after five years, 15% after ten years, 27% after 15 years, and 35% after 20 years. After 23 years, the cumulative risk is thought to exceed 50%. In addition, the cumulative risk of cancer developing in the breasts contralateral to those in which in situ lobular carcinoma was found was 10% after ten years, 15% after 15 years, and 25% after 20 years. The cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer after 22 years appears to exceed 30%. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																10.1001/jama.201.2.82

Forty cases showing only in situ lobular carcioma are not included in this paper, 32 of these having been presented previously. In an initial survey of the material, 142 cases having terminal duct or lobular component or both were separated from 1,396 cases of carcinoma of the breast (10.2%). These cases were re-examined, and by rigid and stringent criteria, 73 cases representing "pure" infiltrating lobular carcinoma were established. This is probably the largest group of infiltrating lobular carcinomas reported to date, and represents about 5% of the cancers examined in this series. In 72 of these 73 cases, histologic evidence of "early," antecedent, in situ lobular carcinoma was found. Once invasion of breast stroma has taken place, the sequence is similar to that in the more frequent carcinomas of duct origin. Patterns of lobular carcinoma of the breast occur more frequently than previously supposed. Recommendations for treatment, depending on whether the tumor is non-infiltrating or infiltrating, are discussed. Additional cases of progression from in situ lobular to infiltrating lobular breast cancer are presented. Residual in situ lobular in 72 of 73 cases of "pure" infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the female breast indicates that they form a continuum. When diagnosed it should be treated promptly to forestall (where possible) the sequence of events reported in this paper. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																10.1097/00000658-196608000-00018

ARCH SURG		1965		91-(1)		130-135	130	135							Thirteen patients with in-situ lobular carcinoma of the breast are reported. The follow-up is complete and includes one 24-year survivor. None of these patients has succumbed to breast carcinoma. The natural history, diagnosis, and recommended treatment of in-situ lobular carcinoma of the breast are discussed, stressing the following points. The diagnosis cannot be made grossly or by palpation, ft may be made tentatively on frozen section, but requires careful examination of permanent microscopic sections before definitive treatment is undertaken. In-situ lobular carcinoma is a true cancer. The literature contains 7 cases where invasive carcinoma developed after "preinvasive phases varying from "a few months" to 17 years. In-situ lobular carcinoma is multicentric and frequently bilateral. Combining our patients with those in the literature who had both breasts biopsied, 46% bilaterality is found. We currently recommend simple, mastectomy with contralateral "random biopsy" as treatment for in-situ lobular carcinoma of the breast. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																																		
B	BCI:BCI19634100018909				Lobular carcinoma of the breast		BORDEN, A. G. B.									Tenth International Congress of Radiology. Book of Abstracts Montreal, Quebec, Canada No. 346		1962				p. 145-146	145	146							Lobular carcinoma of the breast, first described as a separate entity in 1941 by Foote and Stewart, represents an early stage in the development of mammary cancer. According to Urban, if diagnosed in its pre-invasive stage, lobular carcinoma carries a 100% cure rate following simple mastectomy and low axillary dissection. A review of the roentgenograms of 687 patients over an eleven year period with proven carcinoma of the breast was made in an effort to correlate diagnostic criteria of lobular carcinoma of the breast. Of the five patients presented here, one died three years after her second mastectomy for lobular carcinoma, and the other four patients have been followed for a period of eighteen months to ten years without recurrence. All our cases were diagnosed radiographically and proven by surgical exploration. The anatomical appearance and location of the lesions were found to correspond to the x-ray findings. The roentgen appearance of lobular carcinoma is that of an infiltrating mass lesion which varies in size, shape, and which may alter the architecture, shape, or density of a part or the entire breast. Lobular carcinoma is usually found in the breast of symptomatic middle-aged women with severe adenosis. The involved breast is often denser than the opposite breast and occasionally changed in shape (re versed sausage). Periodic roentgen studies performed every three to six months showing progression of any of the above findings are of great value in diagnosing lobular infiltrating carcinoma of the breast during its early invasive phase. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author

CANCER RES		1961		21	( 1)	9-16	9	16							The development of benign and malignant neoplasms was studied in thyroid glands of Long-Evans rats 2 years after either both lobes of the glands had been irradiated with 500, 1000, or 2000 r, or the right lobe alone had been irradiated with 1000 r. The degree of follicular atrophy and of nuclear pleomorphism observed in these irradiated glands varied with the dose of X-rays. Benign nodules or adenomas were observed in 30 of the 74 irradiated survivors. These lesions originated as foci of nodular regeneration and hyperplasia. Papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas were found in 9 of the irradiated rats. Two of the 6 papillary carcinomas appeared to have originated in previously benign adenomas. Naturally occurring alveolar or lobular carcinomas had an incidence of 33% in normal control rats and of 22-45% in rats whose thyroids were irradiated withX-rays. These naturally occurring carcinomas were of low-grade malignancy and were unlike those induced by irradiation. Parathyroid hyperplasia and adenomas were observed frequently in control as well as in irradiated rats. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors

Papillary and follicular carcinomas were observed in 12 of the I131-injected rats. Benign thyroid nodules or adenomas were observed in all but 2 of the rats given I131. Three of these adenomas were of the papillary type. Naturally occurring alveolar or lobular carcinomas were found in approximately 1/3 of the rats. The high incidence of hyperplastic and neoplastic parathyroid lesions observed in the I131-treated rats is not considered to be an irradiation effect. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors

AMER JOUR PATH		1941		17	(4)	491-495	491	495							The term lobular mammary carcinoma in situ is employed to designate a rare form of cancer occurring but twice in pure form in a series of 300 primary operable mammary cancers. Clinical and gross pathological diagnosis in the non-infiltrative phase cannot be made. Diagnosis depends on microscopic examination. Simple mastectomy is required even when infiltration is absent for the disease occurs in multiple foci. Varying periods of time may elapse before infiltration and metastasis occur. In one case, infiltration and metastasis took place in a space of a few mos. and in another, the disease remained confined for over a yr. This tumor infiltrates in a peculiar, characteristic fashion and about one mammary cancer in 20 can be traced to a lobule and terminal duct origin as shown by the infiltrative pattern combined with outlying foci of non-infiltrative carcinoma The term "totilobular mammary carcinoma" is proposed, to emphasize an origin in all the components of the mammary lobule. The term "acinar" carcinoma is rejected since the authors regard the acinus as a physiological structure of pregnancy and lactation and not as a fixed anatomic unit. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors
