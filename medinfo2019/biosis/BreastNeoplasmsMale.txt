J	BCI:BCI201800850769	30044713			Incidence of Breast Cancer in the Life Span Study of Atomic Bomb Survivors: 1958-2009		Brenner, Alina, V (brennera@rerf.or.jp) ; Preston, Dale L.; Sakata, Ritsu; Sugiyama, Hiromi; de Gonzalez, Amy Berrington; French, Benjamin; Utada, Mai; Cahoon, Elizabeth K.; Sadakane, Atsuko; Ozasa, Kotaro; Grant, Eric J.; Mabuchi, Kiyohiko									Radiation Research		2018	OCT 2018	190	4	433-444	433	444							The importance of reproductive history in breast tissue development and etiology of sporadic breast cancer in females is well established. However, there is limited evidence of factors, other than age, that modify risk of radiation-related breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated breast cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, adding 11 years of follow-up and incorporating reproductive history data. We used Poisson regression models to describe radiation risks and modifying effects of age and reproductive factors. Among 62,534 females, we identified 1,470 breast cancers between 1958 and 2009. Of 397 new cases diagnosed since 1998, 75% were exposed before age 20. We found a strong linear dose response with excess relative risk (ERR) of 1.12 per Gy [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.59] for females at age 70 after exposure at age 30. The ERR decreased with increasing attained age (P = 0.007) while excess absolute rate (EAR) increased with attained age up to age 70 (P < 0.001). Age at menarche was a strong modifier of the radiation effect: for a given dose, both the ERR and EAR decreased with increasing age at menarche (P = 0.007 and P < 0.001). Also, independently, age-at-exposure effects on ERR and EAR differed before and after menarche (P = 0.043 and P = 0.015, respectively, relative to log-linear trends), with highest risks for exposures around menarche. Despite the small number of male breast cancers (n = 10), the data continue to suggest a (lase response (ERR per Gy = 5.7; 95% CI: 03 to 30.8; P = 0.018). Persistently increased risk of female breast cancer after radiation exposure and its modification pattern suggests heightened breast sensitivity during puberty.

Current Science (Bangalore)		2018	SEP 10 2018	115	5	845-850	845	850							An analysis of 4168 research papers on male breast cancer (MBC) published by different countries and indexed by Science Citation Index Expanded during 2005-2014 indicates that only 15% of the papers were non-collaborative and the rest were published either in domestic or international collaboration. The sub-field of MBC had a high proportion of domestic collaboration. The number of papers written with domestic collaboration was almost three times the number of papers written with international collaboration. The value of co-authorship index (CAI) decreased in single-, two- and multi-authored papers in the second block 2010-2014 as compared to the first block (2005-2009). Higher value of CAI for mega-authored papers reflects higher collaborative coefficient (CC) in 2010-2014. The highest value of CC is for the sub-field S9 (genetics and heredity). This is also indicated by the highest value of CAI for mega-authored papers in this subfield. Among 17 highly productive institutions, CC value is more or equal to the global value of CC for 10 prolific institutions.														0011-3891	0011-3891	10.18520/cs/v115/i5/845-850

(mariapia.foschini@unibo.it)									Virchows Archiv		2018	AUG 2018	473	2	155-163	155	163							X chromosome gain has been previously described in male breast cancer (MBC). Androgen receptor (AR) gene is located on X chromosome. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the X chromosome gain in the development of MBC and its relation with AR gene copy number and expression.The X chromosome status was assessed in 66 cases of male invasive and in situ duct breast carcinoma, in 34 cases of gynecomastia associated with cancer, and in 11 cases of tumor-free gynecomastia. Cases were tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to assess the X chromosome status and AR amplification. AR expression was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In addition, AR methylation status was assessed.X chromosome gain was observed in 74.7% of invasive duct carcinoma, in 20.6% of in situ duct carcinoma, and in 14.6% of gynecomastia when associated with cancer, while all cases of tumor-free gynecomastia showed wild X chromosome asset. AR gene copy number when increased paralleled the number of X chromosomes. AR IHC expression was observed in 100% of MBC tested. AR gene methylation status revealed low level or absence of methylation.These data suggest that X chromosome can play a role in the neoplastic transformation of male breast epithelium. X chromosome gain is paralleled by AR gene polysomy. Polysomic AR genes show low methylation levels and high AR protein expression on NC. These data should be taken into consideration for MBC treatment planning.														0945-6317	1432-2307	10.1007/s00428-018-2377-2																		
J	BCI:BCI201800633477	29574860			A dietary pattern based on estrogen metabolism is associated with breast cancer risk in a prospective cohort of postmenopausal women		Guinter, Mark A.; McLain, Alexander C.; Merchant, Anwar T.; Sandler, Dale P.; Steck, Susan E. (ssteck@sc.edu)									International Journal of Cancer		2018	AUG 1 2018	143	3	580-590	580	590							Increased exposure to estrogen is a risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer, and dietary factors can influence estrogen metabolism. However, studies of diet and breast cancer have been inconclusive. We developed a dietary pattern associated with levels of unconjugated estradiol and the ratio of 2- and 16-hydroxylated estrogen metabolites in a subsample of Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Screening Trial (PLCO) participants (n=653) using reduced rank regression, and examined its association with postmenopausal breast cancer prospectively in the larger PLCO cohort (n=27,488). The estrogen-related dietary pattern (ERDP) was comprised of foods with positively-weighted intakes (non-whole/refined grains, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, cheese, fish/shellfish high in -3 fatty acids, franks/luncheon meats) and negatively-weighted intakes (nuts/seeds, other vegetables, fish/shellfish low in -3 fatty acids, yogurt, coffee). A 1-unit increase in the ERDP score was associated with an increase in total (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18), invasive (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.04-1.24) and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02-1.24) breast cancer risk after adjustment for confounders. Associations were observed for the fourth quartile of ERDP compared with the first quartile for overall breast cancer (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.98-1.32), invasive cases (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.02-1.42) and ER-positive cases (HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.99-1.41). The increased risk associated with increasing ERDP score was more apparent in strata of some effect modifiers (postmenopausal hormone therapy non-users and non-obese participants) where the relative estrogen exposure due to that factor was lowest, although the p values for interaction were not statistically significant. Results suggest a dietary pattern based on estrogen metabolism is positively associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, possibly through an estrogenic influence.What's new? Serum levels of estrogen metabolites, which may be influenced by certain dietary factors, are associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk. However, studies of diet and breast cancer have been inconclusive. In our study, an estrogen-related dietary pattern (ERDP) was developed based on data from dietary questionnaires and serum concentrations of estrogen metabolites in a subsample of control participants and cancer patients. The ERDP strongly correlated with the intake of refined grains, cheese, lunch meats and yogurt. The ERDP was positively associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, with stronger effects in invasive and estrogen receptor-positive cases.														0020-7136	1097-0215	10.1002/ijc.31387																		
J	BCI:BCI201800769111	29743167			Characterising the adipose-inflammatory microenvironment in male breast cancer		Lees, Tom; Cullinane, Angharad; Condon, Alexandra; Shabaan, Abeer M.; Humphries, Matthew P.; Speirs, Valerie (v.speirs@leeds.ac.uk)									Endocrine-Related Cancer		2018	JUL 2018	25	7	773-781	773	781							Male breast cancer (MBC) incidence seems to parallel global increases in obesity. The stromal microenvironment contributes to carcinogenesis; yet, the role of adipocytes in this is understudied in MBC. We identified four cohorts of male breast tissues diagnosed when obesity was rare (archival cohort) and more common (contemporary cohort). We examined the microenvironment of archival and contemporary cohorts of MBC, diagnosed 1940-1970 and 1998-2006, respectively, with two cohorts of, archival and contemporary gynaecomastia, diagnosed 1940-1979 and 1996-2011, respectively, serving as controls. We quantified adipocytes, crown-like structures (CLS) and the presence of CD8, alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA) and CD68+ macrophages in both cohorts, and determined how these affected survival, in the contemporary MBC cohort. In both MBC cohorts, mean adipocyte diameter was larger in the distant stroma compared with stroma close to the invading tumour (92.2 mu m vs 66.7 mu m). This was not seen in gynaecomastia. CLS were more frequent in both MBC cohorts than gynaecomastia (44/55 (80%) vs 11/18 (61%), P < 0.001). No relationship was found between CLS number and adipocyte size, although there were greater numbers of CLS in contemporary MBC > archival MBC > gynaecomastia. CD8 and CD68 expression in the stroma was significantly associated with reduced survival, with no effects seen with aSMA. Changes in the adipose-inflammatory microenvironment may be a contributing factor to the increase seen in MBC diagnosis.														1351-0088	1479-6821	10.1530/ERC-17-0407																		
J	BCI:BCI201800602011	29032404			Dietary Supplementation with Methylseleninic Acid Inhibits Mammary Tumorigenesis and Metastasis in Male MMTV-PyMT Mice		Sundaram, Sneha; Yan, Lin (lin.yan@ars.usda.gov)									Biological Trace Element Research		2018	JUL 2018	184	1	186-195	186	195							Male breast cancer, which makes up approximately 1% of all breast cancers, is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis. We investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with selenium in the form of methylseleninic acid [(MSeA) 2.5 mg selenium/kg] on mammary tumorigenesis in male MMTV-PyMT mice. The mammary tumor latency was 14.6 weeks for the MSeA-fed group and 13.8 weeks for the controls fed the AIN93G diet (p < 0.05). Dietary supplementation with MSeA, versus the control, resulted in a 72% reduction in tumor progression, a 46% reduction in both final volume and weight of mammary tumors, and a 70% reduction in the number of lung metastases. Mammary tumorigenesis in MMTV-PyMT mice, versus non-tumor-bearing wild-type mice, resulted in significant increases in concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, urokinase plasminogen activator, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor, but not aromatase and estrogen, in the plasma. Concentrations of all variables mentioned above in both plasma and mammary tumors were lower in MSeA-fed mice. Mammary tumorigenesis reduced plasma levels of adiponectin compared to non-tumor-bearing controls. Adiponectin concentrations in mammary tumors, but not in plasma, were higher in MSeA-fed mice than in controls. In summary, dietary supplementation with selenium in the form of MSeA inhibits mammary tumorigenesis and its pulmonary metastasis in male MMTV-PyMT mice.														0163-4984	1559-0720	10.1007/s12011-017-1188-7

Relevant clinical and oncological data and cancer phenotype were retrieved. All participants were genotyped for the predominant Jewish BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations using a chip-based assay. Those who tested negative were further genotyped for three recurring mutations in CHEK2 (c.1100delC, p.S428F, p.I157T), and single mutations in the FANCM (c.5791C > T), and RAD51D (c.556C > T) genes, by direct sequencing. The ethics committee approved the study.Overall, 61 MBC were identified and genotyped, 41 (67.2%) were Ashkenazim, age at diagnosis was 58.1 +/- 12.6 years, and 31 (50.8%) had a family history of cancer. Of genotyped individuals, one (1.6%) harboured the 185delAG* BRCA1 mutation, 7 (11.4%) the 6174delT*BRCA2 mutation and 2 (3.2%) other recurring mutations in BRCA2 (overall 10/61-16.4% BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers). Of BRCA-negative cases, 3/51 (5.9%) carried the p.S428F *CHEK2 mutation. None was a carrier of the other genotyped mutations in CHEK2, FANCM or RAD51D.BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 germline mutations contribute to inherited predisposition to MBC in Israel.

Based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), the early breast cancer patients (T1-2N0-2M0) were extracted from 1998-2007. This study included 1,111 and 2,151 patients with early MBC and FBC, respectively, whose clinicopathological characteristics were well balanced. At a mean follow-up time of 97 months, 10-year OS rate was 58.3% in the MBC group and 68.7% in the FBC (log-rank test, P < 0.001; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.29 to 1.64). Adjusted HR for OS between MBC and FBC were revealed from propensity score matched-multivariable Cox proportional hazards models (HR =1.53, 95% CI = 1.35 to 1.73). Similar adjusted SMRs between MBC and FBC ((SMR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.83,2.14) for FBC and (SMR = 2.07, 95%Cl = 1.88-2.28) for MBC) were observed. The nomogram was constructed for FBC, and predicted probabilities were generally good (C-index=0.71), whose area under curve is higher than TNM stage classification (0.74 vs 0.62). OS was significantly decreased among early MBC patients compared with FBC, but similar SMRs and its trends by age groups were observed between MBC and FBC except for young patients.														2045-2322	2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-018-26199-6																		
J	BCI:BCI201800769114	29752333			The endocrinology of male breast cancer		Fentiman, Ian S. (ian.fentiman@kcl.ac.uk)									Endocrine-Related Cancer		2018	JUN 2018	25	6	R365-R373	R365	R373							Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease but, as a result of epidemiological collaborations, there is now greater clarity concerning endocrine risk factors. The significant rise in global age-standardised mean BMI in men is likely to lead to increases in incidence of maturity-onset diabetes and MBC. The metabolic changes accompanying obesity decrease androgens and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), thereby increasing available oestrogens. The higher rates of MBC in North and Equatorial Africa are largely due to liver damage from endemic bilharziasis and hepatitis B causing elevated oestradiol (E-2) levels from hepatic conversion of androgen. Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY) is associated with a 50-fold increase in incidence of MBC compared with XY males, and this is the most pronounced evidence for testicular malfunction amplifying risk. Delay in presentation means that up to 40% of cases have stage III or stage IV disease at diagnosis. No randomised controlled trials have been reported on endocrine treatment of advanced disease or adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy following or preceding surgery. Tamoxifen is the most effective endocrine therapy, but side effects can lead to non-compliance in a substantial number of men. Aromatase inhibitors are less effective because they do not inhibit testicular oestrogen production. There is an urgent need for collaborative trials to provide an evidence base for the most effective endocrine and least toxic therapies for men with breast cancer.														1351-0088	1479-6821	10.1530/ERC-18-0117

Multiple-gene sequencing has already entered clinical practice for female breast cancer, whereas the performance of panel testing in MBC has not been studied extensively. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of panel testing for MBC, by the largest gene panel used so far, through investigation of patients deriving from a population with known founder effects.Genomic DNA from one hundred and two Greek MBC patients, unselected for age and family history, was used to prepare libraries which capture the entire coding regions of 94 cancer genes.Loss-of-function (LoF) mutations were found in 12.7% of the cases, distributed in six genes: BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, CHEK2, PMS2, and FANCL. BRCA2 mutations were the most frequent, followed by ATM mutations, accounting for 6.9 and 2%, respectively, while mutations in other genes were detected in single cases. Age at diagnosis or family history was not predictive of mutation status. Beyond mutations in established breast cancer predisposing genes, LoF mutations in PMS2 and FANCL among MBC patients are reported here for the first time.Our findings, using the largest gene panel for MBC patients so far, indicate that BRCA testing should be the primary concern for MBC patients. Until sufficient evidence arises from larger studies, multiple-gene panels may be of limited benefit for MBC and their families, at least for MBC patients of specific descent.

Inherited mutations in BRCA1/2 genes account for about 10-15% of all cases. FANCM, functionally linked to BRCA1/2, has been suggested as a novel BC susceptibility gene. Our aim was to test if FANCM germline mutations could further explain male BC (MBC) susceptibility.Methods: We screened the entire coding region of FANCM in 286 MBCs by a multi-gene panel analysis, and compared these data with available whole exome sequencing data from 415 men used as population controls. Moreover, we genotyped the two most frequent FANCM mutations (c.5101C>T and c.5791C>T) in 506 MBCs and 854 healthy male controls.Results: Two FANCM truncating mutations, the c.1432C>T (p.Arg478Ter) and c.1972C>T (p.Arg658Ter), were identified in two MBC cases (0.7%). When specifically considering cases at increased genetic risk for BC, FANCM mutation frequency raises up to 1%. One mutation, the c.2201_2202delCT (p.Ser734Terfs), was found among controls (0.24%). Mutation frequency in cases was higher than in controls, however this difference was not statistically significant. FANCM c.5101C>T was not present in any of the cases and controls analyzed, whereas FANCM c.5791C>T was found in two controls (0.23%).Conclusion: Rare FANCM truncating mutations, other than c.5101C>T and c.5791C>T, may have a role in MBC susceptibility. The inclusion of FANCM in gene panels for research purpose would allow for the identification of a higher number of mutation carriers, thus helping estimate BC risk associated with FANCM mutations.

The first trial was registered in 2015 in four institutions to which some registration committee members belonged. We analyzed the information of 830 Japanese pedigrees, who underwent BRCA1/2 genetic testing, including mutation carriers with BRCA1 (N = 127) and BRCA2 (N = 115), and their families. The mutation-positive rate was 19.7%. Variants of uncertain significance were found in 6.5% of all individuals subjected to genetic testing for BRCA1/2. Compared to the United States, Japan had a higher mutation-positive rate in most categories, except for the groups with male breast cancer. Among the intrinsic subtypes of BRCA1-associated breast cancers, 75.8% were triple-negative. The incidence rate of contralateral breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers was 0.99%/year. Among 240 mutation carriers, 26 and 62 patients underwent risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), respectively; the respective frequencies of occult cancer were 7.1 and 3.2%. Metachronous breast cancer after RRM or peritoneal cancer after RRSO was not observed during the follow-up period. The nationwide registration system began last year and the system enables followup analysis in Japan.														1434-5161	1435-232X	10.1038/s10038-017-0355-1

Endocrine-Related Cancer		2018	MAR 2018	25	3	173-184	173	184							Characterizing male breast cancer (BC) and unraveling male breast carcinogenesis is challenging because of the rarity of this disease. We investigated copy number status of 22 BC-related genes in 18 cases of pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and in 49 cases of invasive carcinoma (IC) with adjacent DCIS (DCIS-AIC) in males using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Results were compared to female BC and correlated with survival. Overall, copy number ratio and aberration frequency including all 22 genes showed no significant difference between the 3 groups. Individual unpaired analysis revealed a significantly higher MTDH copy number ratio in IC compared to DCIS-AIC and pure DCIS (P = 0.009 and P = 0.038, respectively). ADAM9 showed a significantly lower copy number aberration frequency in male BC, compared to female BC (P = 0.020). In DCIS-AIC, MTDH, CPD, CDC6 and TOP2A showed a lower frequency of copy number increase in males compared to females (P < 0.001 for all 4 genes). In IC, CPD gain and CCNE1 gain were independent predictors of poor overall survival. In conclusion, male DCIS and IC showed a similar copy number profile for 21 out of 22 interrogated BC-related genes, illustrating their clonal relation and the genetically advanced state of male DCIS. MTDH showed a higher copy number ratio in IC compared to adjacent and pure DCIS and may therefore play a role in male breast carcinogenesis. Differences were detected between male and female DCIS for 4 genes pointing to differences in breast carcinogenesis between the sexes.														1351-0088	1479-6821	10.1530/ERC-17-0338

International Journal of Cancer		2018	MAR 1 2018	142	5	910-918	910	918							Male breast cancer (MBC) accounts for 1% of all breast cancer. Adult obesity and tallness are risk factors for MBC, but the role of adolescent fatness is largely unknown. We aimed to assess the association between body mass index (BMI) in adolescence and the incidence of MBC in a large cohort of 16- to 19-year-old Israeli males. 1,382,093 Jewish Israeli males aged 16-19 who underwent anthropometric measurements, a general intelligence test (GIT) and other examinations during 1967-2011, were followed up to December 31, 2012 for MBC incidence. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the association between adolescent BMI (as WHO BMI categories and as age-specific CDC percentiles) and time to MBC diagnosis, adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Of 100 MBC cases diagnosed during 29,386,233 person-years of follow-up, 97 were included in multivariable analyses. Compared to healthy BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)) and adjusted for year of birth, country of origin and GIT score, higher adolescent BMI was associated with higher MBC risk: hazard ratio (HR)=2.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.55, p=0.015) in overweight (25.0 <= BMI < 30.0 kg/m(2)) adolescents; and HR=4.97 (95%CI 2.14-11.53, p=0.0002) in obese (BMI >= 30.0 kg/m(2)) adolescents. When CDC age-specific BMI percentiles were assessed results were similar and statistically significant for obesity. In addition, low (vs. high) GIT score (HR=4.76, 95%CI 1.96-12.50, p=0.001) and European (vs. west-Asian) origin (HR=1.99, 95%CI 1.19-3.34, p=0.009) were independent predictors of MBC. Measured adolescent overweight and obesity are associated with increased risk of MBC, suggesting a modifiable risk factor potentially allowing for early intervention. The novel association with cognitive function should be further explored.				Keinan-Boker, Lital/0000-0002-8092-0717										0020-7136	1097-0215	10.1002/ijc.31121

Like the female counterpart, most MBCs are hormonally driven, but relapse after hormonal treatment is also noted. The panhormonal action of steroid hormonal receptors, including estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), androgen receptor (AR), progesterone receptor (PR), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in this understudied tumor type remains wholly unexamined. This study reveals genomic cross-talk of steroid hormone receptor action and interplay in human tumors, here in the context of MBC, in relation to the female disease and patient outcome. Here we report the characterization of human breast tumors of both genders for cistromic make-up of hormonal regulation in human tumors, revealing genome-wide chromatin binding landscapes of ER alpha, AR, PR, GR, FOXA1, and GATA3 and enhancer-enriched histone mark H3K4me1. We integrate these data with transcriptomics to reveal gender-selective and genomic location-specific hormone receptor actions, which associate with survival in MBC patients.

It is mainly classified by immunohistochemistry as a luminal disease. In this study, we assess for the first time the correlation between molecular subtypes based on a validated six-marker immunohistochemical panel and PAM50 signature in male breast cancer, and the subsequent clinical outcome of these different subtypes. We collected 67 surgical specimens of invasive male breast cancer from four different Spanish pathology laboratories. Immunohistochemical staining for the six-marker panel was performed on tissue microarrays. PAM50 subtypes were determined in a research-use-only nCounter Analysis System. We explored the association of immunohistochemical and PAM50 subtypes. Overall survival and disease-free survival were analyzed in the different subtypes of each classification. The distribution of tumor molecular subtypes according PAM50 was: 60% luminal B, 30% luminal A and 10% human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) enriched. Only one Her2-enriched tumor was also positive by immunohistochemistry and was treated with trastuzumab. None of the tumors were basal-like. Using immunohistochemical surrogates, 51% of the tumors were luminal B, 44% luminal A, 4% triple-negative and 1% Her2-positive. The clinicopathological characteristics did not differ significantly between immunohistochemical and PAM50 subtypes. We found a significant worse overall survival in Her2-enriched compared with luminal tumors. Male breast cancer seems to be mainly a genomic luminal disease with a predominance of the luminal B subtype. In addition, we found a proportion of patients with Her2-negative by immunohistochemistry but Her2-enriched profile by PAM50 tumors with a worse outcome compared with luminal subtypes that may benefit from anti-Her2 therapies.

The patients were divided into two groups according to the hormonal therapy used: TAM-treated and AI-treated. MBC was characterized by older age, advanced tumor stage, and higher rate of lymph node metastases, in comparison with FBC. Matching analysis was performed using six prognostic criteria: patient age, tumor stage, tumor grade, lymph node status, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) status, and administration of chemotherapy. The female and male patients were matched 2:1. In this analysis, 316 women and 158 men treated with TAM, and 60 women and 30 men treated with AI, were included. The overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and was compared between FBC and MBC. TAM-treated FBC and MBC patients had similar 5-year OS, 85.1 and 89.2%, respectively (p = 0.972). Notably, FBC patients treated with AI had significantly greater 5-year OS (85.0%) in comparison with AI-treated MBC patients (5-year OS of 73.3%; p = 0.028).Conclusions The OS of TAM-treated patients with MBC was similar to the OS of TAM-treated FBC patients, whereas AI treatment is associated with poorer survival of MBC patients.														0171-5216	1432-1335	10.1007/s00432-017-2539-7

The choice of hormone therapy is related to multiple factors, including menopausal state, patient preference, and potential side effects. Molecular profiling has allowed therapy to be tailored for an individual patient to some extent. However, further molecular studies are needed to individualize the choice and length of adjuvant hormone therapy. Ongoing studies are evaluating the role of additional targeted therapies, such as CDK4/6 inhibitors, to further improve outcome for patients with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.														0927-3042(print)		10.1007/978-3-319-70197-4_2	978-3-319-70195-0(H); 978-3-319-70197-4(P)

Previous studies on occupational risk factors of breast cancer were often restricted to women who are frequently exposed to lower levels and at a lower frequency than men. We investigated the association between MBC and occupational exposure to petroleum and oxygenated and chlorinated solvents in a multicenter case-control study of rare cancers in Europe.Methods The study included 104 MBC cases and 1901 controls. Detailed lifetime work history was obtained during interviews, together with sociodemographic characteristics, medical history and lifestyle factors. Occupational exposures to solvents were estimated from a job-exposure matrix. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression models.Results Lifetime cumulative exposure to trichloroethylene >23.9 ppm years was associated with an increased MBC risk, compared to non-exposure [OR (95% CI): 2.1 (1.2-4.0); P trend <0.01). This increase in risk persisted when only exposures that occurred >= 10 years before diagnosis were considered. In addition, a possible role for benzene and ethylene glycol in MBC risk was suggested, but no exposure-response trend was observed.Conclusions These findings add to the evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer among men professionally exposed to trichloroethylene and possibly to benzene or ethylene glycol. Further studies should be conducted in populations with high level of exposure to confirm our results.

Acta Oncologica (Stockholm)		2018		57	5	622-628	622	628							Background: The prognosis of breast cancer has improved significantly during the last few decades increasing the interest in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The aim of this study was to compare the HRQoL scores produced by different instruments and to shed light on their validity in various states of breast cancer by studying the association of cancer-related symptoms with HRQoL.Material and methods: An observational, cross-sectional study of breast cancer patients treated in the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District from September 2009 to April 2011. A total of 840 patients completed three HRQoL questionnaires: the EQ-5D-3L (including VAS), 15D and EORTC QLQ-30 and a questionnaire concerning sociodemographic factors. Patients were divided into five mutually exclusive groups: primary treatment (n=118), recovery (6-18 months from diagnosis) (n=150), remission (>18 months) (n=382), metastatic disease (n=176) and palliative care (n=14). The association of HRQoL with sociodemographic and clinical factors and cancer-related symptoms, screened by the EORTC QLQ-30, was studied by multivariate modeling using stepwise linear regression analysis.Results: HRQoL scores were the best at the time closest to diagnosis and deteriorated with disease progression. The EQ-5D had a pronounced ceiling effect with 40.8% of the respondents scoring 1 (perfect health) compared to 6% for the 15D and 5.6% for VAS. In regression analyses, pain, fatigue and financial difficulties were the most important predictors of lower HRQoL. The 15D showed better discriminatory power and content validity. The EORTC QLQ-C30 functioning deteriorated in advanced states of the disease with physical, social and role functioning being the most affected. Insomnia, fatigue and pain were the most commonly reported symptoms in all groups.Conclusions: Different HRQoL instruments produce notably different HRQoL scores. The EQ-5D has a pronounced ceiling effect. Pain and fatigue are the most common symptoms associated with poor HRQoL in all disease states.

Some extrapolate the results from female breast cancer trials, while others advocate systematic adjuvant irradiation. We evaluated clinical practices and outcomes with respect to radiation therapy in MBC treated with locoregional irradiation in the adjuvant setting using a systematic literature review. Material and Methods: We included studies with data about adjuvant radiotherapy published between 1984 and 2017 and including at least 40 patients. Results: We found 29 retrospective series, 10,065 men were diagnosed with breast cancer; 3-100% (mean=54%) received adjuvant radiotherapy. Tumor size and nodal involvement were the strongest prognostic factors. Approximatively half of all cases had nodal metastases. Radiation therapy improved locoregional control in six series, overall survival in three and distant metastasis-free survival in one. Conclusion: MBC is diagnosed at a highly advanced stage and may be linked with poorer outcomes. Adjuvant radiation therapy must, at least, be proposed to men with positive nodes. Despite the large number of cases gathered here, arguments for radiotherapy in other prognostic subgroups (especially in pN0) may exist but are not well supported.				thariat, juliette/0000-0003-4755-496X										0250-7005	1791-7530	10.21873/anticanres.12187

(Asperen@lumc.nl)									Clinical Genetics		2018	JAN 2018	93	1	52-59	52	59							To establish whether existing mutation prediction models can identify which male breast cancer (MBC) patients should be offered BRCA1 and BRCA2 diagnostic DNA screening, we compared the performance of BOADICEA (Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm), BRCAPRO (BRCA probability) and the Myriad prevalence table (Myriad). These models were evaluated using the family data of 307 Dutch MBC probands tested for BRCA1/2, 58 (19%) of whom were carriers. We compared the numbers of observed vs predicted carriers and assessed the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) for each model. BOADICEA predicted the total number of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers quite accurately (observed/predicted ratio: 0.94). When a cut-off of 10% and 20% prior probability was used, BRCAPRO showed a non-significant better performance (observed/predicted ratio BOADICEA: 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.60-1.09] and 0.79, 95% CI: [0.57-1.09], vs. BRCAPRO: 1.02, 95% CI: [0.75-1.38] and 0.94, 95% CI: [0.68-1.31], respectively). Myriad underestimated the number of carriers in up to 69% of the cases. BRCAPRO showed a non-significant, higher AUC than BOADICEA (0.798 vs 0.776). Myriad showed a significantly lower AUC (0.671).

Ultrasound showed enlarged left axillary lymph nodes. An excisional biopsy was conducted on 3 lymph nodes. The pathological diagnosis was determined to be metastatic adenocarcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the lymph nodes. Further physical examination of the patient yielded a 1.5-cm hard, left subareolar mass.Interventions and outcomes: The patient underwent modified radical mastectomy. The diagnosis was grade II invasive ductal carcinoma (stage IIA). The axillary lymph node showed MCL (stage I, group A), but not metastatic ductal carcinoma. The patient received chemotherapy, including 6 courses of CHOP (A chemotherapy protocol consists of cyclophosphamide 1.2g day 1, doxorubicin 80 mg day 1, vindesine 4 mg day1, and prednisone 90 mg from day 1 to 5) for lymphoma and breast cancer. The patient was also administered endocrine therapy. After a 54-month follow-up, the patient was well with no evidence of disease.Lessons: MPMNs are easily misdiagnosed as a primary and metastatic tumor, leading to delayed or erroneous treatment. Male breast cancer in a patient with MCL is rare. Early diagnosis and proper therapy are necessary for an optimal prognosis. Further studies are required to define the mechanisms and risk factors of MPMNs.														0025-7974	1536-5964	10.1097/MD.0000000000008911

As concordant male breast cancers are utterly rare, discordant associations of male breast cancer with other cancers may reveal genetic and possible environmental risk factors contributing to male breast cancer susceptibility.We calculated relative risks (RRs) for male breast cancer in families with discordant cancers, and conversely, for discordant cancers in families of male breast cancer patients, based on 15.7 million individuals in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database.Among 1428 male breast cancer patients, 16.2% had a female relative diagnosed with breast cancer. Ovarian and female anal cancers showed the strongest associations with male breast cancer (p value < 0.0005). The other significant associations included colorectal, small intestinal, and thyroid cancers, cancer of unknown primary and non-Hodgkin lymphoma but these were each based on a single positive association with male breast cancer. The RRs for male breast cancer were increased in families in which multiple patients were diagnosed with diverse cancers, reaching an RR of 2.58 when three or more family members were affected.The results suggest that male breast cancer shares susceptibility with a number of other cancers but confirmation is needed in other datasets.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-017-4468-1

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2017	DEC 2017	166	3	903-910	903	910							Male breast cancer is a rare and understudied disease predominantly affecting men over age 60. Risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) in men increases with age. We examined ATE risk following primary breast cancer diagnosis in elderly men.Men with primary breast cancer diagnoses from 2002 to 2011 were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare-linked database. Cases were individually matched by age, sex, race, registry, and comorbidities with controls without cancer using SEER-Medicare's 5% noncancer sample. Medicare claims were used to identify ATE, defined as myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. Cumulative incidence of ATE was calculated using competing risk methodology, with death considered a competing event. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compare rates of ATE among cases and controls.Three months following primary breast cancer diagnosis, ATE risk in the cohort of 881 men was 80% higher than matched controls (hazard ratio 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.0-3.2). Six months post-cancer diagnosis, 5.7% of cases had experienced ATE, whereas only 3.5% of controls had (HR 1.6; 95% CI 1.0-2.6). ATE risk remained elevated 12 months post-cancer diagnosis. Among cases, risk of death was threefold higher in men who developed ATE.We provide population-based evidence that male breast cancer patients have a substantially elevated risk of ATE in the first year following a cancer diagnosis compared with matched controls. Care providers should consider this heightened risk when evaluating cardiovascular health in men with a recent breast cancer diagnosis.

Black male breast cancer patients were more likely to be in stages II-IV and have more advanced tumors. The rate of lymph node (LN) involvement at diagnosis was higher in black men than in whites and others. The ER-and PR-positive rates were lower in black men than in whites and others. The distant metastasis rate was higher in blacks than in whites and others. Furthermore, the overall survival (OR) rates and breast cancer-specific survival rates were significantly poorer in blacks than in whites and others (X-2 = 29.974, P < 0.001; X-2 = 7.285, P = 0.026, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, the results showed that race could also be a prognostic indicator (P < 0.001). Moreover, significant differences were also observed in OS among 1: 1: 1 matched white, black, and other groups (P < 0.001). Differences in outcomes may be partially explained by differences in tumor grades, LN status, and ER and PR status between the 3 groups. This study might provide insights into a better understanding of male breast cancer.														1949-2553	1949-2553	10.18632/oncotarget.18265

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of several histological features in a large series of male BC.Methods: Central pathology review was performed for 1483 male BCs collected through part 1 of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) International Male BC Program. Pathology review included histological subtype, grade, mitotic activity index (MAI), presence of a fibrotic focus and density of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These features were correlated with clinical outcome. The relationship between these features and surrogate molecular subtypes using immunohistochemistry was also assessed.Results: Median follow-up for overall survival (OS) was 7.1 years. Overall histological grade was not significantly associated with OS (p = 0.129). MAI, the presence of a fibrotic focus and a low TIL density however were correlated with unfavourable OS (p = 0.023, p = 0.004 and p = 0.011, respectively). BC subtype correlated with TIL density (p = 0.015), as we observed a higher density for human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) positive BC compared to luminal HER2-negative subtype. No association was observed between subtype and fibrotic focus.Conclusions: Histologic grade was not significantly correlated with clinical outcome in this series, unlike what is seen in female patients. These results contribute to our understanding of male BC and indicate the importance of further research on the optimisation of risk stratification and treatment decisions for male BC patients.

Herein we investigated the ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 signalings in male breast cancer (MBC). The expression of DDR kinases (pATR, pATM, pChk1, pChk2, and pWee1) and DNA damage markers (pRPA32 and gamma-H2AX) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 289 MBC samples to assess their association. Survival analyses were carried out in 112 patients. Survival curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test. Cox proportional regression models were generated to identify variables impacting survival outcomes. The expression of pATR conferred poorer survival outcomes (log rank p = 0.013, p = 0.007 and p = 0.010 for overall, 15- and 10-year survival, respectively). Multivariate Cox models of 10-year survival and overall indicated that pATR expression, alone or combined with pChk2, was an independent predictor of adverse outcomes (10-year survival: pATR: HR 2.74, 95% CI: 1.23-6.10; pATR/pChk2: HR 2.92, 95% CI: 1.35-6.33; overall survival: pATR: HR 2.58, 95% CI: 1.20-5.53; pATR/pChk2: HR 2.89, 95% CI: 1.376.12). Overall, the ATR/ATM-initiated molecular cascade seems to be active in a fraction of MBC patients and may represent a negative prognostic factor.

But the incidence is rising and in some patient groups reaching 15% over the course of their lives. The major risk factors for the development of male breast cancer include advancing age, hormonal imbalance, radiation exposure, and a family history of breast cancer. Regarding the latter, incidence can be linked to mutations in high- or low-penetrance genes. The most relevant risk factor for the development of male breast cancer is a mutation in the BRCA2 gene. Most cases present late because of a lack of awareness of the existence of such a malignancy in males and ignorance of the related risk factors. Additionally, males with breast cancer are at special risk for developing a second cancer. This in depth review highlights the epidemiology and risk factors for the development of male breast cancer.

We have previously reported that the expression of the Hippo transducers TAZ/YAP and their target CTGF was associated with inferior survival in MBC patients. Preclinical evidence demonstrated that Axl is a transcriptional target of TAZ/YAP. Thus, we herein assessed AXL expression to further investigate the significance of active TAZ/YAP-driven transcription in MBC. For this study, 255 MBC samples represented in tissue microarrays were screened for AXL expression, and 116 patients were included. The association between categorical variables was verified by the Pearson's Chi-squared test of independence (2-tailed) or the Fisher Exact test. The relationship between continuous variables was tested with the Pearson's correlation coefficient. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for estimating survival curves, which were compared by log-rank test. Factors potentially impacting 10-year and overall survival were verified in Cox proportional regression models. AXL was positively associated with the TAZ/CTGF and YAP/CTGF phenotypes (P=0.001 and P=0.002, respectively). Patients with TAZ/CTGF/AXL- or YAP/CTGF/AXL-expressing tumors had inferior survival compared with non-triple-positive patients (log rank P=0.042 and P=0.048, respectively). The variables TAZ/CTGF/AXL and YAP/CTGF/AXL were adverse factors for 10-year survival in the multivariate Cox models (HR 2.31, 95%CI:1.02-5.22, P=0.045, and HR 2.27, 95%CI:1.00-5.13, P=0.050). Nearly comparable results were obtained from multivariate analyses of overall survival. The expression pattern of AXL corroborates the idea of the detrimental role of TAZ/YAP activation in MBC. Overall, Hippo-linked biomarkers deserve increased attention in this rare disease. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 2246-2252, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study seeks to validate the discriminating value of this bioscore among non-metastatic breast cancer patients registered within the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database.Methods Through SEER*Stat program, SEER database (2010-2013) was accessed and bioscore was formulated for each patient. Overall and cancer-specific survival analyses according to both bioscore and AJCC pathological stages were conducted through Kaplan-Meier analysis/log-rank testing, and multivariate analysis was conducted through a Cox proportional model.Results A total of 181030 patients with non-metastatic, surgically treated breast cancer were identified in the period from 2010 to 2013. For overall and cancer-specific survival assessment according to the bioscore system, P values for pairwise comparisons among different score points were significant (P < 0.0001) except for the comparison between score 0 and score 1. For cancer-specific survival assessment according to the AJCC stages, P values for pairwise comparisons among different stages were significant (P < 0.0001) except for the comparison between stages IIIB and IIIC. For overall survival assessment according to the AJCC stages, P values for pairwise comparisons among different stages were significant (P < 0.001) except for the comparison between stages IA and IB. In a multivariate analysis, the following factors were associated with better cancer-specific survival (earlier stage disease, ER positivity, PR positivity, Her2 neu positivity, and nuclear grade) (P < 0.0001).Conclusion The current analysis confirms the prognostic utility of the bioscore system and suggests it may be incorporated into decision-making algorithms for non-metastatic breast cancer.

The paucity of reported cases among men may provide insight to the cell of origin of PPSC. Materials and Methods: A search for the ICD 0-3 code of PPSC (C48.2) in the following datasets: the Israeli National Cancer registry (INCR), the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database in the USA, Israeli male BRCA carriers, male high-risk and BRCA carriers in a USA study, and the Italian Study on Male Breast Cancer (MBC) were performed. Results: In the INCR dataset, 220 entries for C48.2 code were noted, with only one male (male: female ratio=0.0045). In the SEER dataset for histology codes of papillary/serous/adenocarcinoma, 2,673 cases were recorded, with five males (male: female ratio=0.0018). None of the recorded US or Italian male BRCA carriers or MBC, or Israeli male BRCA carriers was diagnosed with PPSC. Conclusion: PPSC is a rare neoplasm, seemingly not associated with BRCA mutations in men, and fallopian tube epithelial cell implants may contribute to its development.														0250-7005	1791-7530	10.21873/anticanres.11662

Although still rare, male breast cancer (MBC) is being diagnosed more frequently. Treatments are wholly informed by clinical studies conducted in women, based on assumptions that underlying biology is similar.Experimental Design: A transcriptomic investigation of male and female breast cancer was performed, confirming transcriptomic data in silico. Biomarkers were immunohistochemically assessed in 697 MBCs (n = 477, training; n = 220, validation set) and quantified in pre- and posttreatment samples from an MBC patient receiving everolimus and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor.Results: Gender-specific gene expression patterns were identified. eIF transcripts were upregulated in MBC. eIF4E and eIF5 were negatively prognostic for overall survival alone (log-rank P = 0.013; HR = 1.77, 1.12-2.8 and P = 0.035; HR = 1.68, 1.03-2.74, respectively), or when coexpressed (P = 0.01; HR = 2.66, 1.26-5.63), confirmed in the validation set. This remained upon multivariate Cox regression analysis [ eIF4E P = 0.016; HR = 2.38 (1.18-4.8), eIF5 P = 0.022; HR = 2.55 (1.14-5.7); coexpression P = 0.001; HR = 7.04 (2.22-22.26)]. Marked reduction in eIF4E and eIF5 expression was seen post BEZ235/everolimus, with extended survival.Conclusions: Translational initiation pathway inhibition could be of clinical utility in MBC patients overexpressing eIF4E and eIF5. With mTOR inhibitors that target this pathway now in the clinic, these biomarkers may represent new targets for therapeutic intervention, although further independent validation is required.

Whether FOXM1 has any indication for prognosis in MBC patients remains unknown. We sought to examine the expression levels of FOXM1 in MBC and to identify the relationship between FOXM1 expression and patient survival. Patients and Methods: FOXM1 expression was evaluated in a total of 130 MBC specimens. Results: FOXM1 was overexpressed in 37% of the MBC samples. FOXM1 overexpression was significantly associated with tumor size (p = 0.045), histological grade (p = 0.048), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.012), Ki-67 proliferation index (p = 0.016), and molecular subtypes (p < 0.001). Multivariate analyses indicated that FOXM1 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in MBC patients (p < 0.001, hazard ratio = 0.69 (0.43-0.96)). Conclusions: Overexpression of FOXM1 was associated with well-established markers of poor prognosis; thus FOXM1 may represent a potential novel prognostic marker for MBC. (C) 2017 S.

We assembled 446 MBCs on tissue microarrays and assessed clinicopathological information, together with data from 15 published studies, totalling 1984 cases. By immunohistochemistry we investigated 14 biomarkers (ER alpha, ER beta 1, ER beta 2, ER beta 5, PR, AR, Bcl-2, HER2, p53, E-cadherin, Ki67, survivin, prolactin, FOXA1) for survival impact. The main histological subtype in our cohort and combined analyses was ductal (81%, 83%), grade 2; (40%, 44%), respectively. Cases were predominantly ERa (84%, 82%) and PR positive (74%, 71%), respectively, with HER2 expression being infrequent (2%, 10%), respectively. In our cohort, advanced age (>67) was the strongest predictor of overall (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) (p = 0.00001; p = 0.01, respectively). Node positivity negatively impacted DFS (p = 0.04). FOXA1 p = 0.005) and AR p = 0.009) were both positively prognostic for DFS, remaining upon multivariate analysis. Network analysis showed ERa, AR and FOXA1 significantly correlated. In summary, the principle phenotype of MBC was luminal A, ductal, grade 2. In ER alpha+ MBC, only AR had prognostic significance, suggesting AR blockade could be employed therapeutically.

M.; Clarke, Christina A.; Cheng, Iona; Shariff-Marco, Salma; DeRouen, Mindy; Catalano, Ralph; Satariano, William A.; Davidson-Allen, Kathleen; Glaser, Sally L.									Cancer Causes & Control		2017	FEB 2017	28	2	145-154	145	154							In recent years, cancer case counts in the U.S. underwent a large, rapid decline-an unexpected change given population growth for older persons at highest cancer risk. As these declines coincided with the Great Recession, we examined whether they were related to economic conditions.Using California Cancer Registry data from California's 30 most populous counties, we analyzed trends in cancer incidence during pre-recession (1996-2007) and recession/recovery (2008-2012) periods for all cancers combined and the ten most common sites. We evaluated the recession's association with rates using a multifactorial index that measured recession impact, and modeled associations between case counts and county-level unemployment rates using Poisson regression.Yearly cancer incidence rate declines were greater during the recession/recovery (3.3% among males, 1.4% among females) than before (0.7 and 0.5%, respectively), particularly for prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers. Lower case counts, especially for prostate and liver cancer among males and breast cancer, melanoma, and ovarian cancer among females, were associated with higher unemployment rates, irrespective of time period, but independent of secular effects. The associations for melanoma translated up to a 3.6% decrease in cases with each 1% increase in unemployment. Incidence declines were not greater in counties with higher recession impact index.Although recent declines in incidence of certain cancers are not differentially impacted by economic conditions related to the Great Recession relative to pre-recession conditions, the large recent absolute declines in the case counts of some cancer may be attributable to the large declines in unemployment in the recessionary period. This may occur through decreased engagement in preventive health behaviors, particularly for clinically less urgent cancers. Continued monitoring of trends is important to detect any rises in incidence rates as deferred diagnoses come to clinical attention.														0957-5243	1573-7225	10.1007/s10552-016-0846-y

Radiation Research		2017	FEB 2017	187	2	221-228	221	228							Both red bone marrow and male breast doses with associated uncertainty have been reconstructed for a 1,982-person subset of a cohort of 114, 270 military personnel (referred to as "atomic veterans'') who participated in U.S. atmospheric nuclear weapons testing from 1945 to 1962. The methods used to calculate these doses and corresponding uncertainty have been reported in detail by Till et al. in an earlier publication. In this current article we report the final results of those calculations. These doses are being used in a case-cohort design epidemiological investigation of leukemia and male breast cancer. This cohort of atomic veterans is one component in a broader-scope study of approximately one million U.S. persons designed to investigate risk from chronic low-dose radiation exposure. Doses to the atomic veterans in this sub-cohort were relatively low, with approximately two-thirds receiving red bone marrow doses <5 mGy and only four individuals receiving a red bone marrow dose >50 mGy. The average red bone marrow dose for members of the sub-cohort was 5.9 mGy. Doses to male breast were approximately 20% higher than red bone marrow doses. The uncertainty in the estimated doses was relatively low, considering relevant personnel dosimetry was available for only about 25% of the subjects, and most of the doses were reconstructed from film badges worn by co-workers or from the individual's military record and military unit activities. The average coefficient of variation for the individual dose estimates was approximately 0.5, comparable to the uncertainty in doses estimated for the Japanese A-bomb survivors. Although the reconstructed red bone marrow doses were about 36% lower on average than the conservative doses previously estimated by the military for compensation, the overall correlation was quite good, suggesting that the estimates of doses from external exposure by the military for all similar to 115,000 cohort members could be adjusted appropriately and used in further epidemiological analyses.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations account for about 10% of all MBC cases. Thus, a fraction of MBC cases are expected to be due to genetic factors not yet identified. To further explain the genetic susceptibility for MBC, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and targeted gene sequencing were applied to high-risk, BRCA1/2 mutation-negative MBC cases. METHODS: Germ-line DNA of 1 male and 2 female BRCA1/2 mutation-negative breast cancer (BC) cases from a pedigree showing a first-degree family history of MBC was analyzed with WES. Targeted gene sequencing for the validation of WES results was performed for 48 high-risk, BRCA1/2 mutation-negative MBC cases from an Italian multicenter study of MBC. A case-control series of 433 BRCA1/2 mutation-negative MBC and female breast cancer (FBC) cases and 849 male and female controls was included in the study. RESULTS: WES in the family identified the partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) c. 419delA truncating mutation carried by the proband, her father, and her paternal uncle (all affected with BC) and the N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) c.97C>T nonsense mutation carried by the proband's maternal aunt. Targeted PALB2 sequencing detected the c.1984A>T nonsense mutation in 1 of the 48 BRCA1/2 mutation-negative MBC cases. NAT1 c.97C>T was not found in the case-control series. CONCLUSIONS: These results add strength to the evidence showing that PALB2 is involved in BC risk for both sexes and indicate that consideration should be given to clinical testing of PALB2 for BRCA1/2 mutation-negative families with multiple MBC and FBC cases.

Compared to female breast cancer, the incidence of male breast cancer has risen in recent years, and the relationship between molecular subtype and clinical behavior has rarely been studied. In this study, we examined the molecular subtypes of male breast cancers based on the expression profile of immunomarkers and their association with clinicopathological features. A total of 98 male breast carcinoma patients were investigated retrospectively using immunostaining for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, Ki-67, and P53. Results were interpreted based on the molecular subtype classification of the 13th St Gallen International Expert Consensus (2013). HER2 expression that was 2+ or 3+ was also evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for further validation. The luminal subtype A was the most common in all patients (83.7%, 82/98), followed by the luminal subtype B (16.3%, 16/98). HER-2 subtype and basal-like subtype were not detected. Male breast cancers were classified into luminal subtype A and luminal subtype B, and the HER-2 over-expressing and basal-like subtypes were not found in this study.														1940-5901

We aimed to analyse patient characteristics, locoregional treatment and overall survival (OS) of T1a,b,cN0M0 male breast cancer.Methods: We evaluated men with T1a, b, cN0M0 breast cancer reported to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program from 1988 to 2012. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the effect of each variable on OS.Results: We included 1263 patients. Median age was 66 years (range 27-103). Median follow-up was 62 months (range 1-294). OS at 5 and 10 years were 85.1% and 66.5%, respectively. Distribution according to tumour sub-stage was: T1a 6.5%, T1b 20.7% and T1c 72.8%. Mastectomy was performed in >74% of patients of each tumour size group and overall 44.1% had >5 lymph nodes examined (LNE). Univariate analysis showed that patients with T1c, no surgery and 0 LNE had worse prognosis. In multivariate analysis, older age (hazard ratio [HR] 11.09), grade 3/4 tumours (HR 1.7), no surgery (HR 3.3), 0 LNE (HR 5.1) and unmarried patients (HR 1.7) had significantly shorter OS. There were no differences in OS between breast conservation versus mastectomy and 1-5 LNE versus >5 LNE.Conclusion: Men with early breast cancer have a favourable OS. However, older age, higher grade, no breast surgery, no LNE and unmarried status emerged as poor prognostic characteristics. Efforts to decrease the high rates of mastectomy and extensive LNE should be taken given similar OS observed with breast conservation and 1e5 LNE, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to its rarity, MBC research and clinical approach are mostly based upon data derived from its largely known female counterpart. We aimed at investigating whether MBC cases harbor somatic alterations of genes known as prognostic biomarkers and molecular therapeutic targets in female breast cancer.We examined 103 MBC cases, all characterized for germ-line BRCA1/2 mutations, for somatic alterations in PIK3CA, EGFR, ESR1 and CCND1 genes.Pathogenic mutations of PIK3CA were detected in 2% of MBCs. No pathogenic mutations were identified in ESR1 and EGFR. Gene copy number variations (CNVs) analysis showed amplification of PIK3CA in 8.1%, EGFR in 6.8% and CCND1 in 16% of MBCs, whereas deletion of ESR1 was detected in 15% of MBCs. Somatic mutations and gene amplification were found only in BRCA1/2 mutation negative MBCs.Significant associations emerged between EGFR amplification and large tumor size (T4), ER-negative and HER2-positive status, between CCND1 amplification and HER2-positive and MIB1-positive status, and between ESR1 deletion and ER-negative status.Our results show that amplification of targetable oncogenes is frequent in BRCA1/2 mutation negative MBCs and may identify MBC subsets characterized by aggressive phenotype that may benefit from potential targeted therapeutic approaches.

Like FBC, genetic susceptibility to MBC can be referred to mutations in BRCA1 and, particularly, BRCA2 genes. However, only about 10 % of MBCs are caused by BRCA1/2 germ-line mutations, while the largest part are sporadic cancers and may derive from somatic alterations. EMSY, a BRCA2 inactivating gene, emerged as a candidate gene involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic FBC, and its amplification was suggested to be the somatic counterpart of BRCA2 mutations. Considering the relevant role of BRCA2 in MBC, we aimed at investigating the role of EMSY gene copy number variations in male breast tumors.EMSY copy number variations were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR with TaqMan probes in a selected series of 75 MBCs, characterized for BRCA1/2 mutations.We reported EMSY amplification in 34.7 % of MBCs. A significant association emerged between EMSY amplification and BRCA1/2 mutations (p = 0.03). We identified two amplification subgroups characterized by low and high amplification levels, with BRCA2-related tumors mostly showing low EMSY amplification.Our results show a high frequency of EMSY amplification in MBC, thus pointing to a role of EMSY in the pathogenesis of this disease. EMSY amplification may be a new feature that might uncover underlying molecular pathways of MBCs and may allow for the identification of MBC subgroups with potential clinical implication for targeted therapeutic approaches.

Recurrence analysis could show differences in relapse patterns and/or in patients' approaches that justify these outcomes. Retrospective analysis of MBC patients treated in a cancer center between 1990 and 2014, looking for relapse. For each patient, three matched FBC patients were selected by: diagnosis' year, age (within 5 years), stage and tumors' type (only luminal-like were considered). Differences between cohorts were assessed by chi(2) test and hierarchical clustering was performed to define subgroups according to relapse local. Survival curves were calculated by Kaplan-Meier and compared using log-rank test. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Groups were balanced according to age, histological grade, stage, expression of hormonal receptors and adjuvant treatments. Median time to recurrence was equivalent, p = 0.72, with the majority of patients presented with distant metastases, p = 0.69, with more lung involvement in male, p =0.003. Male patients were more often proposed to symptomatic treatment (21.1% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.02). Overall and from recurrence survivals were poorer for male, median: 5 years [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.1-5.9 years] and 1 year (95% CI: 0-2.1 years) vs. 10 years (95% CI: 7.8-12.2 years) and 2 years (95% CI: 1.6-2.4 years), p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively, and this tendency remained in the five cluster subgroups, that identified five patterns of relapse, p = 0.003. MBC patients had the worst survival, even after controlling important factors, namely the local of relapse. Palliative systemic treatment had favorable impact in prognosis and its frequently avoidance in male could justify the outcomes differences.

The optimal approach for males diagnosed with breast cancer is less clear. We have analyzed the treatment of male breast cancer using a population-based national registry to determine the impact of surgery and radiation therapy on survival.Materials and Methods: The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was queried to identify males with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast who underwent primary surgical resection (radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, total mastectomy, or segmental) for the years 1983 to 2002. Demographic, clinical, and pathologic data were culled and analyzed to determine the impact of radiation therapy (RT) following resection. Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and significance was determined using the log-rank test (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model was performed to determine factors significant for overall (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS).Results: A total of 1337 patients met the eligibility criteria and were analyzed. Median follow-up was 7.3 years (range, 1 mo to 25 y). Most men underwent modified radical mastectomy (n=1062) with a minority undergoing segmental (n=113). About 329 men received postoperative external beam RT. The median rates of OS and CSS for all men were 10.5 years and not yet reached, respectively. The surgical procedure did not significantly associate with OS or CSS. By stage, RT was associated with improved OS for stage I (P=0.03). There was a trend for improved survival with stage II (P=0.21) and HE (P=0.15). RT was not associated with improved CSS by stage. RT improved rates of OS and CSS in N2 patients without reaching statistical significance (P=0.10 and 0.22). On multivariate analysis, advancing age, stage and grade, and no postoperative RT predicted for worse OS. However, when controlled for those with known hormone receptor status (n=978), only the factors of advancing age, stage, grade, and hormone receptor negativity predicted for worse OS. Advancing age, stage, and grade were the only predictors of CSS irrespective of the cohort analyzed.Conclusions: The primary surgical procedure did not ultimately influence OS or CSS in this population-based registry of males with breast cancer. A statistically nonsignificant improvement with postoperative RT was observed in men with lymph node involvement, larger tumor size, or higher stage. When controlled for age, stage, and grade in multivariate analysis, postoperative RT predicted for improved OS but not CSS. These data suggest a beneficial effect of RT in the postoperative setting. A prospective study is necessary to further elucidate appropriate treatment strategies for men with breast cancer.

J	BCI:BCI201600794001	27394005			Paget's disease of the male breast in the 21st century: A systematic review		Adams, Scott J. (scott.adams@usask.ca) ; Kanthan, Rani (rani.kanthan@saskatoonhealthregion.ca)									Breast		2016	OCT 2016	29		14-23	14	23							Paget's disease of the breast is characterized by eczematous changes of the nipple-areolar complex and is associated with an underlying in situ or invasive breast carcinoma in most cases. Histologically, Paget's disease is identified by epithelial cells with abundant basophilic or amphophilic, finely granular cytoplasm with a large, centrally situated nucleus, most abundant in the lower epidermal layers. Due to the rarity of the condition among breast cancers, compounded by the rarity of breast cancer in men, understanding of the disease's presentation, course, and optimal treatment in men is largely derived from case reports and extrapolation of findings from studies in female patients. Paget's disease must be differentiated from other conditions including eczema, Bowen's disease, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Recognition of Paget's disease clinically and pathologically is critical as the superficial lesion may be the only sign of an underlying ductal carcinoma and its presence may be of prognostic significance. This article provides an update on cases of Paget's disease of the breast in men reported in the published literature together with a comprehensive analysis of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Data, 1973-2012. Current understanding and management of the disease in the context of male patients is reviewed. However, additional research is required to further understand the overall pathogenesis and molecular profile of Paget's disease to provide improved insight for personalized, precision-based therapeutic options.

This substantially invites diagnosis challenges and social burdens where the individual needs more personalized therapies and genetic counseling to cope with the condition. This study aims to analyse a total of four male breast cancer cases with or without secondary recurrence. Tissue or saliva samples were analysed with informed and written consent for each individual subjecting to next generation sequencing aiming high throughput investigations. The results revealed two cancer syndromes in an individual with breast and thyroid carcinoma and mutations in PI3KCA, PTEN, NBN, RB1 genes. The rest three cases were identified with alterations in NBN, BRIP1 and BRCA2 mutations.

(reisfilj@mskcc.org)									Clinical Cancer Research		2016	AUG 15 2016	22	16	4045-4056	4045	4056							Purpose: Male breast cancer is rare, and its genomic landscape has yet to be fully characterized. Lacking studies in men, treatment of males with breast cancer is extrapolated from results in females with breast cancer. We sought to define whether male breast cancers harbor somatic genetic alterations in genes frequently altered in female breast cancers.Experimental Design: All male breast cancers were estrogen receptor-positive, and all but two were HER2-negative. Fifty-nine male breast cancers were subtyped by immunohistochemistry, and tumor-normal pairs were microdissected and subjected to massively parallel sequencing targeting all exons of 241 genes frequently mutated in female breast cancers or DNA-repair related. The repertoires of somatic mutations and copy number alterations of male breast cancers were compared with that of subtype-matched female breast cancers.Results: Twenty-nine percent and 71% of male breast cancers were immunohistochemically classified as luminal A-like or luminal B-like, respectively. Male breast cancers displayed a heterogeneous repertoire of somatic genetic alterations that to some extent recapitulated that of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative female breast cancers, including recurrent mutations affecting PIK3CA (20%) and GATA3 (15%). ER-positive/HER2-negative male breast cancers, however, less frequently harbored 16q losses, and PIK3CA and TP53 mutations than ER-positive/HER2-negative female breast cancers. In addition, male breast cancers were found to be significantly enriched for mutations affecting DNA repair-related genes.Conclusions: Male breast cancers less frequently harbor somatic genetic alterations typical of ER-positive/HER2-negative female breast cancers, such as PIK3CA and TP53 mutations and losses of 16q, suggesting that at least a subset of male breast cancers are driven by a distinct repertoire of somatic changes. Given the genomic differences, caution may be needed in the application of biologic and therapeutic findings from studies of female breast cancers to male breast cancers. (C) 2016 AACR.

The present study obtained retrospective clinicopathological data, treatment patterns and outcomes for all male patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the Oncology Department, Faculty Hospital Trencin (Trencin, Slovakia) over the last 21 years from January 1995 to December 2015. A total of 21 patients with male breast cancer were analyzed, with a median patient age of 65.6 years. Two patients were diagnosed with lobular invasive cancer; all others were diagnosed with cancer of a ductal origin. One patient presented with metastatic disease in the pleural cavity. The primary tumors in 8 patients were staged as pT1, whilst 6 patients were staged as pT2 and 7 as pT4. Axillary lymph node involvement was present in 11 patients (52%) and 15 patients were hormone receptor-positive (83%). All but 1 patient underwent mastectomy and surgical staging of the axilla. Adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment was administered in the same manner as breast cancer treatment in female patients. The median follow-up time was 4.5 years. The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 87 and 74%, respectively, and the estimated median disease-free survival for the same population was 9.5 years (95% confidence interval, 6.2-14.6). The survival rates reported in the present retrospective study are comparable with previously published studies. In addition, the current study reported predominant hormone-positive characteristics and rare expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. However, further multi-institutional trials are required to allow for informed treatment decisions in this uncommon disease.														1792-1074	1792-1082	10.3892/ol.2016.4807																		
J	BCI:BCI201600707614	27280636			Expression of phosphorylated eIF4E-binding protein 1, but not of eIF4E itself, predicts survival in male breast cancer		Millican-Slater, Rebecca A.; Sayers, Craig D.; Hanby, Andrew M.; Hughes, Thomas A. (t.hughes@leeds.ac.uk)									British Journal of Cancer		2016	JUL 26 2016	115	3	339-345	339	345							Background: Male breast cancer is rare and treatment is based on data from females. High expression/activity of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) denotes a poor prognosis in female breast cancer, and the eIF4E pathway has been targeted therapeutically. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E activity in female breast cancer is deregulated by eIF4E overexpression and by phosphorylation of its binding protein, 4E-BP1, which relieves inhibitory association between eIF4E and 4E-BP1. The relevance of the eIF4E pathway in male breast cancer is unknown.Methods: We have assessed expression levels of eIF4E, 4E-BP1, 4E-BP2 and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (p4E-BP1) using immunohistochemistry in a large cohort of male breast cancers (n = 337) and have examined correlations with prognostic factors and survival.Results: Neither eIF4E expression nor estimated eIF4E activity were associated with prognosis. However, a highly significant correlation was found between p4E-BP1 expression and disease-free survival (DFS), linking any detectable p4E-BP1 with poor survival (univariate log rank P = 0.001; multivariate HR 8.8, P = 0.0001).Conclusions: Our data provide no support for direct therapeutic targeting of eIF4E in male breast cancer, unlike in females. However, as p4E-BP1 gives powerful prognostic insights that are unrelated to eIF4E function, p4E-BP1 may identify male breast cancers potentially suitable for therapies directed at the upstream kinase, mTOR.

We compared the characteristics of various immunohistochemical markers in N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced mammary adenocarcinomas in male and female Crj:CD(SD)IGS rats including: estrogen receptor a (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), androgen receptor (AR), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (HER2), GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Female mammary adenocarcinomas were strongly positive in the nuclei of tumor cells for PCNA and ER (100%) with only 60% and 53% expressing PgR and GATA3, respectively. 100% of male adenocarcinomas also exhibited strongly positive expression in the nuclei of tumor cells for PCNA, with 25% expressing AR and only 8% showing positivity for ER. Male carcinomas did not express PgR or GATA3 and none of the tumors, male or female, were positive for HER2. Based on the observed ER and PgR positivity and HER2 negativity within these tumors, MNU-induced mammary adenocarcinomas in female rats appear to be hormonally dependent, similar to human luminal A type breast cancer. In contrast, MNU-induced mammary adenocarcinomas in male rats showed no reactivity for ER, PgR, HER2 or GATA3, suggesting no hormonal dependency. Both male and female adenocarcinomas showed high proliferating activity by PCNA immunohistochemistry. Based on our literature review, human male breast cancers are mainly dependent on ER and/or PgR, therefore the biological pathogenesis of MNU-induced male mammary cancer in rats may differ from that of male breast cancer in humans.

Additionally, we analyzed the overall survival (OS) rate of a group of MBC matched to females with breast cancer.We retrospectively analyzed the data from 400 Korean patients who were treated for MBC from 1978 to 2009. Patient demographics and clinical information were routinely documented throughout the study period. Survival and prognostic factors were evaluated. Each MBC patient was matched with 5 female breast cancer (FBC) patients based on 7 characteristics and we compared the OS rates between the 2 groups.For MBC cases, the median follow-up was 72 months and the 5-year OS rate was 85.9%. In univariate analyses, the prognostic factors influencing OS were age (more than 60 years, P<0.001), tumor size (>2cm, P = 0.007), and having a negative progesterone receptor (PR) status (P = 0.042). Only the age (P = 0.028) and tumor size (P = 0.024) were significant prognostic factors for OS in multivariate analysis. After matching, we had 260 male patients matched to 1300 female patients for analysis. Compared with cases among females, the rate of mastectomy was higher among MBC cases and tumors, which were almost invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs), were more likely to be located in the central part of the breast. For MBC cases, the percentage of adjuvant radiation therapy was low compared with female cases. The primary hormone therapy agent used was tamoxifen. The 5-year OS rates were similar in MBC compared with FBC (91.0% vs. 92.6%, P = 0.300).We found that only the age (more than 60 years) and tumor size were independent prognostic factors of survival in MBC. The prognosis for MBC is similar to that for FBC given similar stage and hormone-receptor status.

Prognostic factors are not well established and specific prognostic subgroups are warranted.Patients/methods: Retrospectively revision of 111 cases treated in the same Cancer Center. Blinded-central pathological revision with immunohistochemical (IHQ) analysis for estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and androgen (AR) receptors, HER2, ki67 and p53 was done. Cox regression model was used for uni/multivariate survival analysis. Two classifications of Female Breast Cancer (FBC) subgroups (based in ER, PR, HER2, 2000 classification, and in ER, PR, HER2, ki67, 2013 classification) were used to achieve their prognostic value in MBC patients. Hierarchical clustering was performed to define subgroups based on the six-IHQ panel.Results: According to FBC classifications, the majority of tumors were luminal: A (89.2%; 60.0%) and B (7.2%; 35.8%). Triple negative phenotype was infrequent (2.7%; 3.2%) and HER2 enriched, non-luminal, was rare (<= 1% in both). In multivariate analysis the poor prognostic factors were: size >2 cm (HR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.0-3.4years, p = 0.049), absence of ER (HR: 4.9; 95% CI: 1.7-14.3years, p = 0.004) and presence of distant metastasis (HR: 5.3; 95% CI: 2.2-3.1years, p < 0.001). FBC subtypes were independent prognostic factors (p = 0.009, p = 0.046), but when analyzed only luminal groups, prognosis did not differ regardless the classification used (p > 0.20). Clustering defined different subgroups, that have prognostic value in multivariate analysis (p = 0.005), with better survival in ER/PR+, AR-, HER2- and ki67/p53 low group (median: 11.5 years; 95% CI: 6.2-16.8 years) and worst in PR-group (median: 4.5 years; 95% CI: 1.6 -7.8 years).Conclusion: FBC subtypes do not give the same prognostic information in MBC even in luminal groups. Two subgroups with distinct prognosis were identified in a common six-IHQ panel. Future studies must achieve their real prognostic value in these patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Canadian Canc Registries Epidemiol								Cancer Medicine		2016	MAR 2016	5	3	586-596	586	596							Occupational magnetic field (MF) exposure has been suggested as a risk factor for breast cancer in both men and women. Due to the rarity of this disease in men, most epidemiologic studies investigating this relationship have been limited by small sample sizes. Herein, associations of several measures of occupational MF exposure with breast cancer in men were investigated using data from the population-based case-control component of the Canadian National Enhanced Cancer Surveillance System. Lifetime job histories were provided by 115 cases and 570 controls. Average MF exposure of individual jobs was classified into three categories (<0.3, 0.3 to <0.6, or 0.6T) through expert blinded review of participant's lifetime occupational histories. The impact of highest average and cumulative MF exposure, as well as exposure duration and specific exposure-time windows, on cancer risk was examined using logistic regression. The proportion of cases (25%) with a highest average exposure of 0.3T was higher than among controls (22%). We found an elevated risk of breast cancer in men who were exposed to 0.6T (odds ratio [OR]=1.80, 95% CI=0.82-3.95) when compared to those with exposures <0.3T. Those exposed to occupational MF fields for at least 30years had a nearly threefold increase in risk of breast cancer (OR=2.77, 95% CI=0.98-7.82) when compared to those with background levels of exposure. Findings for the other time-related MF variables were inconsistent. Our analysis, in one of the largest case-control studies of breast cancer in men conducted to date, provides limited support for the hypothesis that exposure to MF increases the risk breast cancer in men.

The risk of cancer in men from BRCA1 and BRCA2 families is relevant to define to motivate genetic testing and optimize recommendations for surveillance.Material and methods. We assessed the risk of cancer in male mutation carriers and their first-degree relatives in 290 BRCA1 and BRCA2 families with comparison to matched controls with the aim to motivate genetic testing and optimize recommendations for surveillance.Results. Mutation carriers in BRCA1 families were not at increased risk of cancer, whereas mutation carriers in BRCA2 families were at increased risk of male breast cancer and prostate cancer with cumulative risks of 12.5% and 18.8%, respectively. Breast cancer developed at a mean age of 59 years, typically as ER/PR positive ductal carcinomas. Prostate cancer developed at a mean age of 68 years, with Gleason scores 8 in 40% of the tumors. The hazard ratio for BRCA2-associated prostate cancer was 3.7 (p < 0.001) in mutation carriers and 3.1 (p = 0.001) in first-degree relatives. Of the 37 prostate cancers, 19 were linked to four BRCA2 mutations within a region defined by c.6373-c.6492. Individuals with mutations herein had a HR of 3.7 for prostate cancer compared to individuals with mutations outside of this region.Conclusions. Male mutation carriers and first-degree relatives in BRCA2 families are at an increased risk of breast cancer and prostate cancer with a potential prostate cancer cluster region within exon 11 of BRCA2.

A 51-year-old man presented with a palpable mass in the left breast was finally diagnosed synchronous bilateral MBC, one an invasive lobular carcinoma and the other an invasive ductal carcinoma. It remains a matter of debate whether invasive lobular carcinoma has better or worse outcome than invasive ductal carcinoma, so that clinicopathological characteristics of tumors are used to evaluate the risk of recurrence. In our case, an unusually small invasive ductal carcinoma with a low level of proliferation had already developed many axillary lymph node metastases in spite of dire clinicopathological characteristics of the invasive lobular carcinoma of the left breast determined during the first treatment, while the invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast was thought to have developed distant metastasis. We report the first case of synchronous bilateral MBC, one an invasive lobular carcinoma and the other an invasive ductal carcinoma, and discuss about the unusual clinicopathological characteristics of these two tumors.														1936-2625	1936-2625

In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis using clinical and pathologic data from 109 nonmetastatic operable male breast cancer patients treated from January 1996 to December 2011 at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital. Log-rank test showed that lower tumor stage, no lymph node involvement, and positive estrogen/progesterone receptor status were good predictors of both disease-free survival and overall survival on univariate analysis. However, hormonotherapy is only a good predictive factor of disease-free survival, and not of overall survival. In addition, based on a Cox proportional hazard regression model, only lymph node involvement, and estrogen/progesterone receptor status were statistically significant predictive factors on multivariate analysis. Our results demonstrated that although adjuvant systemic therapy is used extensively in male breast cancer patients and prognosis has improved over the last few decades, lymph node involvement, and estrogen/progesterone receptor status are still the most important prognostic factors. A prospective multi-center study with a larger sample size is urgently needed to further understand male breast cancer.														1008-682X	1745-7262	10.4103/1008-682X.154992																		
J	BCI:BCI201600210939				Biomarker analysis of a male breast cancer patient with prolonged stable disease under mTOR/PI3K inhibitors BEZ235/RAD001		Brannron, A. Rose; Melisi, Davide; Hummel, Jennifer; Carbone, Carmine; Frizziero, Melissa; Cheung, Wing; Patel, Parul; Gallo, Jorge; Tortora, Giampaolo; Morrissey, Michael; Chen, David									Clinical Cancer Research		2016	JAN 1 2016	22	Suppl. 1	26	26								The mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) has been approved for multiple cancer indications, including ER+/HER2-metastatic breast cancer. The combination of RAD001 with a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 was shown to be even more efficacious than RAD001 alone in preclinical models and was evaluated in clinical trials. We identified a male breast cancer patient who experienced a prolonged stable disease with the RAD001/BEZ235 combination as 3rd line treatment for his metastatic disease and investigated molecular mechanisms to explain the extraordinary benefit and subsequent drug resistance.The 66-year old Caucasian male had stage IIIA invasive ductal carcinoma at initial surgery. He then received two sequential adjuvant therapies: a chemo-radiotherapy and letrozole. When the patient developed multiple metastases, he was treated with chemotherapy and then fulvestrant, before received a 200 mg twice daily BEZ235 and 2.5 mg weekly RAD001 combination regimen, when a left axillary nodal metastasis was developed on fulvestrant. The patient sustained a prolonged stable disease of 18 months while under the therapy before his tumor progressed again.Tumor biopsy samples (formalin fixed, paraffin embedded) were taken from the patient at diagnosis and after progression and analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and whole exome sequencing. Blood samples were collected for germline DNA pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis.PK profile of BEZ235 was collected with C-max, AUC, and T-1/2 of 766 ng/mL, 6308 ng.h/mL, and 5.53 h, respectively. The observed BEZ235 C-min values ranged from 75.5 to 504 ng/mL over the study. The 2.5 mg weekly RAD001 dose is substantially lower than the standard 10 mg daily dose and the C-min could not be reliably determined.IHC assays showed low ER/PR expression (ER 30% 1+; PR 20% 1+, 10% 3+) in the diagnosis sample, but an increase of their expression (60% 1+) in the post progression sample. HER2 expression was negative in both samples. Analysis the same tumor samples using more quantitative AQUA platform demonstrated a drastic 10-fold score increase of ER from 31 to 312 and a 5-fold increase of PR from 271 to 1305. All other examined signaling pathway biomarkers (e.g. pS6, pAKT, pMAPK, pMEK and pEGFR) were expressed in both tumor samples but showed minimal expression changes between the time points.Whole exome sequencing of the diagnosis and post-progression specimens provided average coverage at 142X and 179X, respectively. No functional somatic alterations resulting in hyperactive PI3K/mTOR pathway was detected in genes such as PIK3CA, PTEN, MTOR, TSC1/2 in either tumor samples. In both specimens, a somatic deletion of 16 bp was detected in SPEN, which encodes a potential negative regulator of the estrogen signaling pathway 1.In conclusion, no PI3K/mTOR pathway hyperactivity marker was identified in the diagnostic samples. However, the increased ER/PR expression in the post-progression sample suggests that the effect of PI3K/mTOR pathway blockade by RAD001/BEZ235 might have diminished when the tumor gained further dependence on the hormonal receptor signaling. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that the patient's tumor achieved another prolonged disease control of about 13 months by exemestane, after progression from BEZ235/RAD001 treatment.														1078-0432	1557-3265	10.1158/1557-3265.PMSCLINGEN15-26

Histopathology (Oxford)		2016	JAN 2016	68	1	110-118	110	118							Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon and poorly understood disease. Recent molecular studies have shown important differences from female breast cancer which are likely to influence treatment strategies from the current female-based management towards a more tailored approach. Significantly more MBCs than female breast cancers arise with an underlying germline cancer predisposition, and display a vastly different penetrance compared with females. Furthermore, the genophenotypical association of basal-like cancer with BRCA1 present in female breast cancer is not observed in male breast cancer. Differences in somatic changes between male and female breast cancer have also been reported, with particular enrichment of PIK3CA mutations and a paucity of TP53 mutations. In general, chromosomal-based changes, in particular regions of gains, are seen more frequently in male than female breast cancer and methylation is seen less frequently. Clinically, several molecular subtypes with prognostic relevance have been described, including chromosomal complex high and methylation high groups, and subgroups with profiling signatures pertaining to epithelial mesenchymal transition and hormonal therapy insensitivity. As with female breast cancer, attention to male specific multicentre trials based on the individual characteristics are needed, together with establishment of reliable preclinical models to understand more clearly the pathogenesis of male breast cancer and improve the general poor outcome of this disease.

Although estrogen exposure has been causally linked to the development of female breast cancers, the etiology of male breast cancer is unclear. Here, we show via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) that the Y chromosome was clonally lost at a frequency of similar to 16% (5/31) in two independent cohorts of male breast cancer patients. We also show somatic loss of the Y chromosome gene TMSB4Y in a male breast tumor, confirming prior reports of loss at this locus in male breast cancers. To further understand the function of TMSB4Y, we created inducible cell lines of TMSB4Y in the female human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A. Expression of TMSB4Y resulted in aberrant cellular morphology and reduced cell proliferation, with a corresponding reduction in the fraction of metaphase cells. We further show that TMSB4Y interacts directly with beta-actin, the main component of the actin cytoskeleton and a cell cycle modulator. Taken together, our results suggest that clonal loss of the Y chromosome may contribute to male breast carcinogenesis, and that the TMSB4Y gene has tumor suppressor properties.

In the present study we used a novel biomathematical model to further characterize MBC and to identify differences between male and female breast cancer (FBC).Methods and results: A total of 134 cases of MBC were stained immunohistochemically for 13 key oncoproteins, and staining percentages were used in a mathematical model to identify dependency patterns between these proteins. The results were compared with a large group of FBC (n = 728). MBC and FBC clearly differed on the molecular level. In detail, the results suggest a different role for progesterone receptor (PR) compared to oestrogen receptor (ER) in MBC, while in FBC ER and PR show a similar pattern. In addition, Androgen receptor (AR) seems to be a more powerful effector in MBC. Grades 1 and 2 tumours were clearly separated from grade 3 tumours, and luminal types A and B tumours also showed a different pattern.Conclusions: Defined morphological and molecular phenotypes can be identified in MBC, but these seem to be the result of different molecular mechanisms and perhaps multiple genetic pathways, as characterized previously in FBC, emphasizing the rising concept that MBC and FBC should be regarded as different and unique diseases.														0309-0167	1365-2559	10.1111/his.12727

Compared with low LTPA, medium and high LTPA were not associated with male breast cancer risk (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.79-1.29; 0.90, 0.69-1.18, respectively). In joint-effects analyses, compared with the referent of high body mass index (BMI; >= 25 kg/m(2))/low LTPA, neither medium nor high PA was associated with risk among high BMI men, but normal BMI men (<25 kg/m(2)) with low or medium LTPA were at a nonsignificant similar to 16% reduced risk and those with high LTPA were at a 27% reduced risk (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50-1.07).

X chromosome gain has been described as a marker of aggressive behavior in female breast cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the X chromosome in male breast cancer. Twenty cases of male breast invasive ductal carcinoma were retrieved and compared with 10 cases of gynecomastia. Cases were tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization to assess a cytogenetic profile for the X chromosome. The X chromosome status was compared with histopathologic features and stage at presentation. All MBC cases harbored an X chromosome gain (100%) in a variable percentage of neoplastic cells, ranging from 31% to 85% (mean, 59%). On the contrary, all cases of gynecomastia showed wild X chromosome asset. The patients' age at surgery and tumor grading showed a statistically significant correlation (P = .0188-.04), with the percentages of neoplastic cells showing an X chromosome gain. These data suggest that this X chromosome gain plays a role in the neoplastic transformation of male breast epithelial cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), within the 8q24.21 multi-cancer susceptibility region and within BC-associated loci widespread in the genome, may influence the risk of BC in men, and whether they may be associated with specific clinical-pathologic characteristics of male BC (MBC).In the frame of the ongoing Italian Multicenter Study on MBC, we performed a case-control study on 386 MBC cases, including 50 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, and 1105 healthy male controls, including 197 unaffected BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. All 1491 subjects were genotyped by Sequenom iPLEX technology for a total of 29 susceptibility SNPs. By logistic regression models, we found a significant association with MBC risk for five SNPs: rs1562430 (p = 0.002) and rs445114 (p = 0.026) both within the 8q24.21 region; rs1011970/9p21.3 (p = 0.011), rs614367/11q13.3 (p = 0.016) and rs1314913/14q24.1 (p < 0.0001).Differences in the distribution of rs614367/11q13.3 genotypes according to oestrogen receptor (ER) status (p = 0.006), and of rs1011970/9p21.3 genotypes according to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status (p = 0.002) emerged. Association of rs1011970/9p21.3 risk genotype with HER2+ MBC was confirmed by a multivariate analysis. rs1314913/14q24.1 was associated with increased MBC risk in analyses restricted to male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (p = 0.041).In conclusion, we provided the first evidence that the 8q24.21 region is associated with MBC risk. Furthermore, we showed that the SNPs rs1562430/8q24.21 and rs1314913/14q24.1 strongly influence BC risk in men and suggested that the SNP rs1314913/14q24.1 may act as a risk modifier locus in male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

Male breast cancer is a hormone-driven disease that often expresses the estrogen receptor, and antiestrogen therapy represents the mainstay of treatment. Paradoxically, the advent of a wave of antiestrogens eclipsed the therapeutic potential of alternative therapeutic options. At the beginning of the hormonal therapy era the administration of antiandrogens to metastatic male breast cancer patients was proposed. Ever since the use of these compounds has largely been neglected. A therapeutic role for antiandrogens has been envisioned again in recent years. First, molecular characterization efforts pointed to the androgen receptor as a potential therapeutic target. Second, the development of aromatase inhibitors unexpectedly raised the need for neutralizing androgens in order to tackle endocrine feedback mechanisms responsible for acquired resistance. We herein provide an overview of molecular studies where the androgen receptor was investigated at the genomic, transcriptomic or phenotypic level. We then discuss androgens in the context of the endocrine networks nourishing male breast cancer. Finally, clinical evidence on antiandrogens is summarized along with strategies should be implemented to improve the medical management of these patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Indian Journal of Cancer		2015	OCT-DEC 2015	52	4	526-528	526	528							BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and accounts for 1% of all breast cancers. There is limited data on MBC from India. The aim of our study was to assess clinico-pathological parameters and outcome in MBC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analysis was carried out in 76 patients of MBC who were registered at Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital of All India Institute Of Medical Sciences between 1996 and 2012. Patients' records were retrospective reviewed and data obtained from the computer database using International Classification of Diseases code (C-50). RESULTS: The median age was 59 years (range: 28-80). The median duration of symptoms was 11 months (range: 0.5-40). Breast lump was the most common presenting symptom (left >right side). American Joint Committee on Cancer (7th edition) stage distribution was Stage I-2.6%, Stage II-13.1%, Stage III-59.3% and Stage IV-25%. Modified radical mastectomy was the commonest surgical procedure. Moreover, 30% of tumors were high-grade and 70% had pathological node positive disease. Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu positivity was 80% and 28%, respectively. Triple negative breast cancer constituted 19% of cases. With a median follow-up of 36 months, 3 years relapse free survival and overall survival was 60% and 80%. Advanced stage and visceral metastasis at baseline predicted poor outcome. CONCLUSION: MBC constituted 0.8% at our institute. Our study population had a longer time to presentation, advanced disease at presentation, more HER2/neu positivity and triple negativity higher than the available literature.														0019-509X	1998-4774	10.4103/0019-509X.178399																		
J	BCI:BCI201500801843	25990542			Genome methylation patterns in male breast cancer - Identification of an epitype with hypermethylation of polycomb target genes		Johansson, Ida; Lauss, Martin; Holm, Karolina; Staaf, Johan; Nilsson, Cecilia; Fjallskog, Marie-Louise; Ringner, Markus; Hedenfalk, Ingrid (Ingrid.Hedenfalk@med.lu.se)									Molecular Oncology		2015	OCT 2015	9	8	1565-1579	1565	1579							Male breast cancer (hoc) is a rare disease that shares both similarities and differences with female breast cancer (FBC). The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in MBC and compare them with the previously identified transcriptional subgroups of MBC, luminal M1 and M2, as well as the intrinsic subtypes of FBC. Illumina's 450K Infinium arrays were applied to 47 MBC and 188 FBC tumors. Unsupervised clustering of the most variable CpGs among MBC tumors revealed two stable epitypes, designated ME1 and ME2. The methylation patterns differed significantly between the groups and were closely associated with the transcriptional subgroups luminal M1 and M2. Tumors in the ME1 group were more proliferative and aggressive than ME2 tumors, and showed a tendency toward inferior survival. ME1 tumors also displayed hypermethylation of PRC2 target genes and high expression of EZH2, one of the core components of PRC2. Upon combined analysis of MBC and FBC tumors, ME1 MBCs clustered among luminal B FBC tumors and ME2 MBCs clustered within the predominantly luminal A FBC cluster. The majority of the MBC tumors remained grouped together within the clusters rather than being interspersed among the FBC tumors. Differences in the genomic location of methylated CpGs, as well as in the regulation of central canonical pathways may explain the separation between MBC and FBC tumors in the respective clusters. These findings further suggest that MBC is not readily defined using conventional criteria applied to FBC. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2015	OCT 2015	153	3	679-687	679	687							The purpose of the article was to assess whether smoking affects survival in male breast cancer patients for the overall population and when stratified by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Data were obtained by linking the 1996-2007 Florida Cancer Data System, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, and the US Census. Inclusion criteria were males a parts per thousand yen18 years, diagnosed with breast cancer and residing in Florida (n = 1573). To analyze the association between smoking and survival, we performed sequential multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models with progressive adjustment for main confounders. Compared to never smokers, worse survival was found in current (hazard ratio = 1.63; 95 % CI = 1.23-2.16) but not in former smokers (1.26; 0.99-1.59). Those who smoked a parts per thousand yen1 packs/day had worse survival (2.48; 1.59-3.87) than never smokers with a significant dose-response (P for linear trend < 0.001). Race-ethnic stratified models comparing current and former smokers with never smokers found significant differences among Whites [(1.88; 1.44-2.44) and (1.31; 1.04-1.65, respectively)] and non-Hispanics, [(1.73; 1.31-2.28) and (1.31; 1.04-1.66, respectively)]. Overall, current smokers were found to have significantly reduced survival, which was worse by intensity of smoking. Also, any smoking history is associated with worse survival in White and non-Hispanic male breast cancer patients compared to never smokers. Thus, male breast cancer patients should be advised to quit smoking.

The aim of this study was to study the risk of breast cancer in men on 5-ARI, in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) not on 5-ARI, and in men without BPH.We performed a population-based cohort study in Sweden with data from The Prescribed Drug Register, The Patient Register, and The Cancer Register. Men on 5-ARI, men on alpha-blockers, or men who had undergone a transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) prior to or during 2006-2008 were included as exposed to BPH and a specific treatment thereof. For each exposed man, five unexposed men were selected. Risk of breast cancer was calculated in Cox proportional hazard models.There were 124,183 exposed men and 545,293 unexposed men, and during follow-up (median 6 years), 99 men with breast cancer were diagnosed. Compared to unexposed men, men on 5-ARI had a hazard ratio (HR) of breast cancer of 0.74 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.27-2.03), men on alpha-blockers had HR 1.47 (95 % CI 0.73-2.95), and men with a TUR-P had HR 1.99 (95 % CI 1.05-3.75).No increased risk of breast cancer was observed for men on 5-ARI. However, the increased risk of breast cancer among men who had undergone a TUR-P, a strong indicator of BPH, suggests that the endocrine milieu conducive to BPH is associated with male breast cancer.														0957-5243	1573-7225	10.1007/s10552-015-0622-4

The early diagnosis of breast cancer is the most demanding of all tumors, because it is the most common cancer in women worldwide. We have described a new approach to analyze humoral immune reactions against 4 T1 cell antigens in female mice, reporting that the IgG and IgM responses differed and varied over time and between individuals. In this study, we compared and analyzed the detection of tumor antigens with IgG and IgM from the sera of male mice that were injected with 4 T1 cells into the mammary gland nipple in 2D immunoblot images. The variability in IgM and IgG responses in female and male mice with breast cancer at various stages of disease was characterized, and the properties with regard to antigen recognition were correlated statistically with variables that were associated with the individuals and tumors.The ensuing IgG and IgM responses differed. Only the IgG response decreased over time in female mice - not in male mice. The IgM response was maintained during tumor development in both sexes. Each mouse had a specific pattern of antigen recognition - ie, an immunological signature - represented by a unique set of antigen spots that were recognized by IgM or IgG. These data would support that rationale IgM is a better tool for early diagnosis, because it is not subject to immunosuppression like IgG in female mice with breast cancer. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of each tumor subtype in MaBC and its association with prognosis compared with other factors. We evaluated MaBC patients between 2010 and 2012 with known estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor [together hormone receptor (HR)] status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Patients were classified as: HR-positive/HER2-negative, HR-positive/HER2-positive, HR-negative/HER2-positive, and triple-negative (TN). Univariate and multivariate analyses determined the effect of each variable on overall survival (OS). We included 960 patients. Patient distribution was 84.9 % HR-positive/HER2-negative, 11.6 % HR-positive/HER2-positive, 0.6 % HR-negative/HER2-positive, and 2.9 % TN. TN patients were younger, had higher grade, presented with more advanced stage, were more likely to have mastectomy, and to die of breast cancer (all P < 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that HER2 positivity was associated with shorter OS (hazard ratio 1.90, P = 0.031) and TN patients had worse prognosis (hazard ratio 5.10, P = 0.0004). In multivariate analysis, older patients (hazard ratio 3.10, P = 0.032), those with stage IV (hazard ratio 16.27, P < 0.001) and those with TN tumors (hazard ratio 4.61, P = 0.002) had significantly worse OS. We observed significant differences in patient characteristics according to tumor subtype. HER2-positive and TN represented a small proportion of cases. In addition to age and stage, tumor subtype has clear influence on OS in MaBC.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-015-3488-y

Breast		2015	AUG 2015	24	4	481-486	481	486							Background: Tamoxifen remains the standard hormonotherapy for Male breast cancer patients (MBC). Previous studies, in women, tried to evaluate the impact of CYP2D6 polymorphisms in tamoxifen efficacy with conflicting results. Herein we analyze the relation between CYP2D6*4 polymorphism and survival in MBC patients.Patients and methods: Fifty-three patients, proposed to tamoxifen in adjuvant setting, were enrolled. Clinical information was collected from records and histological revision with additional immunochemistry analysis was done to better characterize the tumors. Comprehensive CYP2D6*4 genotyping from blood or tumor tissue was performed and translated into two predicted metabolic activity groups.Results: Patients included in the two CYP2D6*4 groups did not differ concerning to age, histological characteristics, and primary treatments performed. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years-old and patients were submitted at least to mastectomy and adjuvant hormonotherapy. Recurrence was observed in 7 patients (13.2%) and 13 patients (25.5%) died with a 5-year disease-free survival of 86.2%. The poorer metabolizer group had a high risk for recurrence (p = 0.034) and this outcome effect remains in different subgroups: in tumors larger than 2 cm (p < 0.001), nodal status, N0 vs N+ (p = 0.04) and in advanced stage, stage III (p < 0.001). Poorer metabolizer patients had also a worse overall survival when tumors were larger than 2 cm (p = 0.03).Conclusions: In our series, there was an association between CYP2D6*4 polymorphism and a probability of recurrence, with a consistent effect in risk groups defined by classic prognostic factors. Multicentric studies with larger samples are needed to validate these results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2015	JUL 2015	152	1	51-55	51	55							Male breast cancer (mBC) is a rare entity. As detection of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow of females with early stage breast cancer is a promising prognostic marker, we aimed to determine the prevalence and prognostic value of DTCs in mBC. Bone marrow aspirates were collected from male patients undergoing primary surgery for early stage breast cancer (T1-4, N0-2, M0) at Tuebingen University, Germany, between January 2001 and April 2015. DTCs were identified by immunocytochemistry (pancytokeratin antibody A45/B-B3) and cytomorphology. 24 patients with mBC were included into the analysis. DTCs were detected in four of these (17 %). There was no significant association between the DTC status and any other clinicopathological parameter. Also, no significant impact of the DTC status on DFS or OS could be observed. DTCs are detectable in patients with early stage mBC. The detection rate is comparable to that in women. No associations between DTCs and clinicopathological features or prognosis were observed, which is most likely due to the small sample size. The detection of DTCs in male patients with early stage breast cancer emphasizes the transmission of future clinical applications for DTCs from women to men.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-015-3440-1

Proof of de novo mutations in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) families is rare, in contrast to founder mutations, thousands of years old, that may be carried by as much as 1% of a population. Thus, if mutations favoring cancer survive selection pressure through time, they must provide advantages that compensate for the loss of life expectancy.MethodThis hypothesis was tested within 2,150 HBOC families encompassing 96,325 individuals. Parameters included counts of breast/ovarian cancer, age at diagnosis, male breast cancer and other cancer locations. As expected, well-known clinical parameters discriminated between BRCA-mutated families and others: young age at breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and male breast cancer. The major fertility differences concerned men in BRCA-mutated families: they had lower first and mean age at paternity, and fewer remained childless. For women in BRCA families, the miscarriage rate was lower. In a logistic regression including clinical factors, the different miscarriage rate and men's mean age at paternity remained significant.ResultsFertility advantages were confirmed in a subgroup of 746 BRCA mutation carriers and 483 non-carriers from BRCA mutated families. In particular, female carriers were less often nulliparous (9.1 % of carriers versus 16.0 %, p = 0.003) and had more children (1.8 +/- 1.4 SD versus 1.5 +/- 1.3, p = 0.002) as well as male carriers (1.7 +/- 1.3 versus 1.4 +/- 1.3, p = 0.024).ConclusionAlthough BRCA mutations shorten the reproductive period due to cancer mortality, they compensate by improving fertility both in male and female carriers.

Craig; Speirs, Valerie (v.speirs@leeds.ac.uk)									BMC Medicine		2015	JUN 4 2015	13		Article No.: 134	134								While rare compared to female breast cancer the incidence of male breast cancer (MBC) has increased in the last few decades. Without comprehensive epidemiological studies, the explanation for the increased incidence of MBC can only be speculated. Nevertheless, one of the most worrying global public health issues is the exponential rise in the number of overweight and obese people, especially in the developed world. Although obesity is not considered an established risk factor for MBC, studies have shown increased incidence among obese individuals. With this observation in mind, this article highlights the correlation between the increased incidence of MBC and the current trends in obesity as a growing problem in the 21st century, including how this may impact treatment. With MBC becoming more prominent we put forward the notion that, not only is obesity a risk factor for MBC, but that increasing obesity trends are a contributing factor to its increased incidence.

(p.j.vandiest@umcutrecht.nl)									Cellular Oncology		2015	JUN 2015	38	3	237-245	237	245							Overall, HER2-amplified female breast cancer (FBC) is associated with a high grade, an aggressive phenotype and a poor prognosis. In male breast cancer (MBC) amplification of HER2, located on chromosome 17, occurs at a lower frequency than in FBC, where it is part of complex rearrangements. So far, only few studies have addressed the occurrence of chromosome 17 alterations in small MBC cohorts.Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to detect and characterize copy number changes on chromosome 17 in a cohort of 139 MBC. The results obtained were compared to those in FBC, and were correlated with clinicopathological features and patient outcome data.We observed a lower frequency of chromosome 17 copy number changes with less complex rearrangement patterns in MBC compared to FBC. Chromosome 17 changes in MBC included gains of 17q and losses of 17p. Whole chromosome 17 polyploidies were not encountered. Two recurrent chromosome 17 amplicons were detected: on 17q12 (encompassing the NEUROD2, HER2, GRB7 and IKZF3 gens) and on 17q23.1 (encompassing the MIR21 and RPS6KB1 genes). Whole arm copy number gains of 17q were associated with decreased 5 year survival rates (p = 0.010). Amplification of HER2 was associated with a high tumor grade, but did not predict patient survival. Although copy number gains of HER2 and NEUROD2 were associated with a high tumor grade, a high mitotic count and a decreased 5 year survival rate (p = 0.015), only tumor size and NEUROD2 copy number gains emerged as independent prognostic factors.In MBC chromosome 17 shows less complex rearrangements and fewer copy number changes compared to FBC. Frequent gains of 17q, encompassing two distinct amplicons, and losses of 17p were observed, but no whole chromosome 17 polyploidies. Only NEUROD2 gains seem to have an independent prognostic impact. These results suggest different roles of chromosome 17 aberrations in male versus female breast carcinogenesis.

It is also unknown whether the addition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues to AIs would be a superior strategy or not. This pooled analysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. All studies that examined the efficacy of AIs in metastatic male breast cancer were considered eligible. Overall, 15 studies (105 cases) were eligible for this pooled analysis. The mean age of the study sample was 62.8 years. ER status was positive in all eligible cases. AI was given as first line in 61.5 % of cases. GnRH analogue was co-administered with AI in 37.1 % of cases (n = 39). CR, PR, SD and PD were achieved in 5.7, 23.8, 37.2 and 33.3 % of cases, respectively. The median PFS and OS were equal to 10.0 and 39.0 months, respectively. Co-administration of GnRH analogues was associated with more than threefold increase in rates of clinical benefit (OR = 3.37, 95 % CI 1.30-8.73) but did not seem to correlate with better PFS or OS. No statistically significant associations between the examined outcomes and the other parameters were noted. Available data suggest that AIs may potentially play a promising role in the optimal therapeutic strategy for metastatic male breast cancer patients.

A total of 2953 subjects (2403 index patients and 550 family members of affected carriers) from 36 centers participated in this study between May 2007 and December 2013. All participants received genetic counseling and BRCA genetic testing. In total, 378 mutation carriers among 2403 index patients were identified. The prevalence of BRCA mutations in specific subgroups was as follows: 22.3 % (274/1228) for breast cancer patients with a family history of breast/ovarian cancers, 8.8 % (39/441) for patients with early-onset (< 35 years) breast cancer without a family history, 16.3 % (34/209) for patients with bilateral breast cancer, 4.8 % (1/21) for male patients with breast cancer, and 37.5 % (3/8) for patients with both breast and ovarian cancer. From an analysis of the mutation spectrum, 63 BRCA1 and 90 BRCA2 different mutations, including 44 novel mutations, were identified. The c.7480 (p.Arg2494Ter) mutation in BRCA2 (10.1 %) was the most commonly identified in this cohort. The KOHBRA study is the largest cohort to identify BRCA mutation carriers in Asia. The results suggest that the prevalence of BRCA mutations in familial breast cancer patients is similar to that among Western cohorts. However, some single risk factors without family histories (early-onset breast cancer, male breast cancer, or multiple organ cancers) may limit the utility of BRCA gene testing in the Korean population.

CHEK2 germline mutations are associated with increased risk of breast cancer and other malignancies. From a clinical perspective, the most significant mutation identified is the c.1100delC mutation, which is associated with an approximately 25% lifetime breast cancer risk. The distribution of this mutation shows wide geographical variation; it is more prevalent in the Northern European countries and less common, or even absent, in Southern Europe. In order to estimate the frequency of the CHEK2 c.1100delC mutation in Greek breast cancer patients, we genotyped 2,449 patients (2,408 females and 41 males), which was the largest series ever tested for c.1100delC. The mean age of female and male breast cancer diagnosis was 49 and 59 years, respectively. All patients had previously tested negative for the Greek BRCA1 founder and recurrent mutations. The CHEK2 c.1100delC mutation was detected in 0.16% (4 of 2,408) of females, all of whom were diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 50 years. Only one c.1100delC carrier was reported with breast cancer family history. The present study indicates that the CHEK2 c.1100delC mutation does not contribute substantially to hereditary breast cancer in patients of Greek descent.

(p.j.vandiest@umcutrecht.nl) ; Goldschmeding, Roel; van der Wall, Elsken; Nguyen, Tri Q.									PLoS One		2015	MAR 4 2015	10	3	Article No.: e0118957	e0118957								Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is a member of the CCN family of secreted proteins that are believed to play an important role in the development of neoplasia. In particular, CTGF has been reported to play an important role in mammary tumorigenesis and to have prognostic value in female breast cancer (FBC). The aim of the present study was to investigate clinicopathologic correlations and prognostic value of CTGF in male breast cancer (MBC) and to compare these findings with FBC. For this, we studied CTGF protein expression by immunohistochemistry in 109 MBC cases and 75 FBC cases. In MBC, stromal CTGF expression was seen in the majority of the cases 78% (85/109) with high expression in 31/109 cases (28.4%), but expression in tumor cells was only seen in 9.2% (10/109) of cases. High stromal CTGF expression correlated with high grade and high proliferation index (> 15%) assessed by MIB-1 immunohistochemical staining. CTGF expression in tumor epithelial cells did not correlate with any of the clinicopathologic features. In FBC, stromal CTGF expression positively correlated with mitotic count and tumor CTGF expression was associated with triple negative status of the tumor (p = 0.002). Neither stromal nor tumor epithelial cell CTGF expression had prognostic value in MBC and FBC. In conclusion, stromal CTGF expression was seen in a high percentage of MBC and was correlated with high grade and high proliferation index. In view of the important role of the microenvironment in cancer progression, this might suggest that stromal CTGF could be an interesting target for novel therapies and molecular imaging. However, the lack of association with prognosis warrants caution. The potential role of CTGF as a therapeutic target for triple negative FBC deserves to be further studied.

Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention		2015	MAR 2015	24	3	520-531	520	531							Background: The etiology of male breast cancer is poorly understood, partly due to its relative rarity. Although tobacco and alcohol exposures are known carcinogens, their association with male breast cancer risk remains ill-defined.Methods: The Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project consortium provided 2,378 cases and 51,959 controls for analysis from 10 case-control and 10 cohort studies. Individual participant data were harmonized and pooled. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate study design-specific (case-control/cohort) ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI), which were then combined using fixed-effects meta-analysis.Results: Cigarette smoking status, smoking pack-years, duration, intensity, and age at initiation were not associated with male breast cancer risk. Relations with cigar and pipe smoking, tobacco chewing, and snuff use were also null. Recent alcohol consumption and average grams of alcohol consumed per day were also not associated with risk; only one subanalysis of very high recent alcohol consumption (> 60 g/day) was tentatively associated with male breast cancer (ORunexposed referent = 1.29; 95% CI, 0.97-1.71; OR>0-<7 g/day referent = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.04-1.77). Specific alcoholic beverage types were not associated with male breast cancer. Relations were not altered when stratified by age or body mass index.Conclusions: In this analysis of the Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project, we found little evidence that tobacco and alcohol exposures were associated with risk of male breast cancer.Impact: Tobacco and alcohol do not appear to be carcinogenic for male breast cancer. Future studies should aim to assess these exposures in relation to subtypes of male breast cancer. (c) 2014 AACR.

Although other genes are also involved, predisposing genetic factors to MBC include germline mutations in the BRCA genes (BRCA2). Among the other genes, partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) is considered a moderate-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility gene that may also play a role in MBC predisposition. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the PALB2 gene status in 8 MBC cases selected from a cohort of 181 hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer probands. We performed PALB2 mutational analysis by direct sequencing of 13 exons and adjacent intronic regions. This study showed the presence of a PALB2 truncating mutation in 1/8 (12.5%) cases. This novel mutation was named c.1285_1286delAinsTC (p.I429SfsX12) and is localized in exon 4 of PALB2, in the region encoding for the ChAM motif which is important for the efficient association of PALB2 to chromatin and for recruitment of the BRCA complex to accumulate RAD51 at double-strand break sites. Our findings indicate that PALB2 could be added to the list of breast cancer susceptibility genes also in families with MBC cases.

Similar to p120ctn, delta-catenin contains nine central Armadillo repeats and binds to the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) of E-cadherin. We used immunohistochemistry to detect delta-catenin expression in breast carcinoma (128 cases), and delta-catenin mRNA and protein expression was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting (45 cases). The effects of delta-catenin on the activity of small GTPases and the biological behavior of breast cancer cells were explored by pulldown, flow cytometry, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium, and Matrigel invasion assays. The results showed that delta-catenin expression increased in breast cancer tissues and was associated with a higher degree of malignancy (invasive lobular breast cancer, high tumor-node-metastasis stage, lymph node metastasis, and C-erbB-2+) and poor prognosis. Postoperative survival was shorter in patients with delta-catenin-positive expression than in patients with negative expression. delta-Catenin may regulate Cdc42/Rac1 activity, promote proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells, and alter cell cycle progression. We conclude that delta-catenin tends to overexpress in breast carcinoma and promotes the malignant phenotype.														1010-4283	1423-0380	10.1007/s13277-014-2680-8

Patients and Methods: In 32 male breast carcinomas we evaluated the correlation between: (i) lymphatic vessel density (LVD), distribution of podoplanin-immunostained vessels (DPV), blood vessel density (BVD), infiltration of immune cells and (ii) known clinicopathological parameters. Results: Lymphatic and blood vessels were found in 77.8% and 100% of breast carcinomas, respectively. Double-negative estrogen and progesterone receptor tumors (ER-/PR-) presented significantly higher LVD than ER/PR positive cases, while high-grade tumors exhibited significantly higher DPV than low-grade carcinomas. We detected significantly higher frequency of vascular invasion in high-grade and double-negative carcinomas than in low-grade and ER/PR-positive ones, respectively. Conclusion: The relationship between high number of lymphatic vessels and high tumor grade or steroid receptor negativity might confirm the hypothesis regarding the influence of lymphangiogenesis on the formation of a more aggressive phenotype in male breast cancer.														0250-7005	1791-7530

This is the first pooled analysis of the literature to synthesize all available data and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant in male breast cancer. This study was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. All studies that examined the efficacy of fulvestrant in male breast cancer, regardless of sample size, were considered eligible. The search strategy retrieved 31 articles; of these, five articles were eligible (23 patients) for this pooled analysis. The mean age of the study sample was 63.1 years. Adjuvant hormonal treatment was administered in 87.5 % of cases. Fulvestrant was given as first or second line in 40 % of patients, while as third line or beyond in 60 % of patients. 79.0 % of patients at fulvestrant administration had visceral metastases. Regarding best response, in 26.1 % PR was achieved, in 47.8 % of cases SD was recorded, whereas in 26.1 % of patients PD was noted. The median PFS was equal to 5 months. No grade 3 and 4 adverse events were recorded; of note, hot flashes were reported in 18.2 % of male breast cancer patients. Fulvestrant may potentially play a promising role in the optimal therapeutic strategy for male patients with breast cancer diagnosis. However, further clinical and pharmacokinetic investigations are more than warranted before fulvestrant use becomes a common practice in male breast cancer patients.

Treatment of men with early-stage BC is based on standards established in female BC. Prognostic or predictive markers to guide therapeutic decisions, in particular in early-stage male BC, are missing. Here, we explored whether disseminated tumor cells (DTC) in bone marrow (BM) and circulating tumor cells (CTC) in blood could be suitable biomarkers in male BC.Five male patients (pT2-4, pN0-2, M0) with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, and ductal primary BC (median age 70 years, range 51-73) were enrolled in a prospective study of patients with early-stage breast cancer. Here, we analyze the male subgroup. DTC in BM were analyzed before therapy and identified by immunocytochemistry using the pancytokeratin antibody A45B/B3. Blood samples (10 ml) were analyzed for CTC using the AdnaTest BreastCancer (AdnaGen AG, Langenhagen, Germany).DTC were found in three out of five male patients (60 %) with two DTC detected in one patient and one DTC detected in each of the other two patients. This is compared to a detection rate of 25-40 % in pooled analyses of female patients. CTC were only found in one of five patients. After a median follow-up time of 3 years (range 1-10 years), all patients were still alive and free of relapse.The prevalence of DTC and CTC in male BC seems comparable with female BC. No prognostic relevance could be documented in this small population. A prospective study or at least larger cases series will be required to assess the prognostic or predictive value of DTC and CTC in this rare disease.														0171-5216	1432-1335	10.1007/s00432-014-1784-2

Clinical and pathologic characteristics of early onset breast cancer are not well defined in BRCA mutation carriers and non-carriers.Methods: 194 women diagnosed with breast cancer at 35 years of age or less who had BRCA1/2 mutation testing were included in the study. Logistic regression models were fit to determine the associations between clinical variables and BRCA status.Results: Thirty-two (17%) and 12 (6%) patients had BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, respectively. BRCA1-carriers had a higher likelihood of a positive family history (FH) of breast and/or ovarian cancer (P = 0.001), or first-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer at <50 years old (P = 0.001) compared to non-carriers. BRCA2-carriers were more likely to have a FH of male breast cancer compared to non-carriers (P = 0.02). Among BRCA2-carriers, the age at first full-term pregnancy was younger in ERnegative cases compared with ERpositive cases (19.5 vs. 28.5 years old; P = 0.01). BRCA1-carriers with a later age at menarche were more likely to have a later stage at diagnosis (P = 0.04). Non-carriers with a lower BMI were more likely to have lymph node involvement (P = 0.03).Conclusions: Several associations were identified between reproductive risk factors or BMI and disease characteristics. Further characterization may result in a better understanding of the trends in young onset breast cancer in BRCA-carriers and non-carriers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.				Hashmi, S.

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2014	DEC 2014	148	3	623-628	623	628							Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare and poorly understood. Like female breast cancer (FBC), MBCs are highly sensitive to hormonal changes, and hyperestrogenism, specifically, represents a major risk factor for MBC. MBC is considered similar to late-onset, post-menopausal estrogen/progesteron receptors positive FBC (ER+/PR+). Sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1) is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of estrogens. Recently, SULT1A1 common functional polymorphism Arg(213)His (638G > A) variant has been found to be associated with increased breast cancer (BC) risk, particularly in post-menopausal women. For this reason, we decided to explore whether SULT1A1 Arg(213)His could exert an effect on MBC development. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the SULT1A1 Arg(213)His polymorphism on MBC risk. The secondary aim was to investigate possible associations with relevant clinical-pathologic features of MBC. A total of 394 MBC cases and 786 healthy male controls were genotyped for SULT1A1 Arg(213)His polymorphism by PCR-RFLP and high-resolution melting analysis. All MBC cases were characterized for relevant clinical-pathologic features. A significant difference in the distribution of SULT1A1 Arg(213)His genotypes was found between MBC cases and controls (P < 0.0001). The analysis of genotype-specific risk showed a significant increased MBC risk in individuals with G/A (OR 1.97, 95 % CI 1.50-2.59; P < 0.0001) and A/A (OR 3.09, 95 % CI 1.83-5.23; P < 0.0001) genotypes in comparison to wild-type genotype, under co-dominant model. A significant association between SULT1A1 risk genotypes and HER2 status emerged. Results indicate that SULT1A1 Arg(213)His may act as a low-penetrance risk allele for developing MBC and could be associated with a specific tumor subtype associated with HER2 overexpression.

Additionally, endocrine therapy is the most important treatment in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive advanced breast cancer. This study was aimed to investigate the role of AR in MBC treatment and prognosis and to analyse the relationship between AR and the effect of tamoxifen treatment in MBC patients.Methods: AR protein levels and other tumour characteristics (e. g. expression of ER (ESR1), PR (PGR), AR, HER2 (ERBB2) and Ki-67 (MKI67)) in breast cancer tissue from 102 MBC patients were determined using immunohistochemical analysis. Additionally, the relationship between AR status and clinicopathological features was analysed using the chi(2)-test. Association with survival was initially analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis was used to adjust for other prognostic indicators.Results: High expression of AR was not correlated with T-stage, histological grade, HER2 status and the status of other sex hormone receptors, but was associated with lymph node metastases (P=0.032). AR-positive patients showed significantly shorter 5-year overall survival (OS) rates (P=0.045) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates (P=0.026) than AR-negative patients. By contrast, for patients who received tamoxifen therapy, AR-negative patients showed a higher clinical benefit rate than AR-positive patients (P=0.025). Additionally, the median TTP and OS were significantly different (P=0.02 for TTP; P=0.029 for OS).Conclusions: AR expression correlates strongly with both OS and DFS in patients with MBC. AR-positive patients can predict a poorer clinical outcome than AR-negative patients after adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.														0804-4643	1479-683X	10.1530/EJE-14-0278

(charles.rutter@yale.edu) ; Chagpar, Anees B.; Evans, Suzanne B.									International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics		2014	OCT 1 2014	90	2	329-334	329	334							Objectives: Radiation therapy for left-sided breast cancer has been associated with an elevated risk of cardiac mortality, based on studies predating treatment planning based on computed tomography. This study assessed the impact of tumor laterality on overall survival (OS) in a large cohort treated with modern techniques, to indirectly determine whether left-sided treatment remains associated with increased cardiac mortality.Methods and Materials: Patients treated for breast cancer with breast conserving surgery and adjuvant external beam radiation therapy were identified in the National Cancer Database, and OS was compared based on tumor laterality using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Separate analyses were performed for noninvasive and invasive carcinoma and for breast-only and breast plus regional nodal radiation therapy. Multivariate regression analysis of OS was performed with demographic, pathologic, and treatment variables as covariates to adjust for factors associated with breast cancer-specific survival.Results: We identified 344,831 patients whose cancer was diagnosed from 1998 to 2006 with a median follow-up time of 6.04 years (range, 0-14.17 years). Clinical, tumor, and treatment characteristics were similar between laterality groups. Regional nodal radiation was used in 14.2% of invasive cancers. No OS difference was noted based on tumor laterality for patients treated with breast-only (hazard ratio [HR] 0.984, P = .132) and breast plus regional nodal radiation therapy (HR 1.001, P = .957). In multivariate analysis including potential confounders, OS was identical between left and right sided cancers (HR 1.002, P = .874). No significant OS difference by laterality was observed when analyses were restricted to patients with at least 10 years of follow-up (n = 27,725), both in patients treated with breast-only (HR 0.955, P = .368) and breast plus regional nodal radiation therapy (HR 0.859, P = .155).Conclusions: Radiation therapy for left-sided breast cancer does not appear to increase the risk of death in this national database relative to right-sided tumors. Consequently, radiation therapy-induced cardiac disease may be less prominent than previously demonstrated.

Aromatase inhibitors are widely used for treating metastatic male breast cancer patients. In this setting, their use is not substantiated by prospective clinical trials, but is rather driven by similarities supposedly existing with breast cancer in postmenopausal women. This oversimplified approach was questioned by studies addressing the molecular and endocrine roots of the disease. In this manuscript, we discuss relevant aspects of the current use of aromatase inhibitors in metastatic male breast cancer in light of the most updated evidence on the molecular landscape of the disease and the specific changes in the hormonal background occurring with aging. We further point to strategies for blocking multiple hormonal pathway nodes with the goal of improving their therapeutic potential. We searched PubMed from its inception until March 2014 for relevant literature on the use of aromatase inhibitors in metastatic male breast cancer. Selected terms were combined and used both as medical headings and text words. The reference list of the suitable manuscripts was inspected for further publications. Aromatase inhibitors represent the mainstay of treatment in the metastatic setting. Yet, efforts aimed at sharpening the therapeutic potential of aromatase inhibitors still pose a challenge due to the paucity of data. The choice of dual hormonal (or sequential) therapy combining aromatase inhibitors with a GnRH analogue may represent a valid alterative, particularly if informed by cancer- and patient-related features including molecular, endocrine, and clinic characteristics.

J	BCI:BCI201400704983	24457463			Nuclear HIF1A expression is strongly prognostic in sporadic but not familial male breast cancer		Deb, Siddhartha (siddhartha.deb@petermac.org) ; Johansson, Ida; Byrne, David; Nilsson, Cecilia; Constable, Leonie; Fjallskog, Marie-Louise; Dobrovic, Alexander; Hedenfalk, Ingrid; Fox, Stephen B.	kConFab Investigators								Modern Pathology		2014	SEP 2014	27	9	1223-1230	1223	1230							Male breast cancer is poorly understood with a large proportion arising in the familial context particularly with the BRCA2 germline mutation. As phenotypic and genotypic differences between sporadic and familial male breast cancers have been noted, we investigated the importance of a hypoxic drive in these cancers as this pathway has been shown to be of importance in familial female breast cancer. Expression of two major hypoxia-induced proteins, the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1A) and the carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), examined within a large cohort including 61 familial (3 BRCA1, 28 BRCA2, 30 BRCAX) and 225 sporadic male breast cancers showed that 31% of all male breast cancers expressed either HIF1A (25%) and/or CA9 (8%) in the combined cohort. Expression of HIF1A correlated with an increased incidence of a second-major malignancy (P=0.04), histological tumor type (P=0.005) and basal phenotype (P=0.02). Expression of CA9 correlated with age (P=0.004) in sporadic cases and an increased tumor size (P=0.003). Expression of HIF1A was prognostic for disease-specific survival in sporadic male breast cancers (HR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5-9.8, P=0.006) but not within familial male breast cancer, whereas CA9 was only prognostic in familial male breast cancers (HR: 358.0, 95% CI: 9.3-13781.7, P=0.002) and not in sporadic male breast cancer. This study found that hypoxic drive is less prevalent in male breast cancer compared with female breast cancer, possibly due to a different breast microenvironment. The prognostic impact of HIF1A is greatest in sporadic male breast cancers with an alternate dominant mechanism for the oncogenic drivers suggested in high risk familial male breast cancers.

Johansson, Ida; Killander, Fredrika; Linderholm, Barbro; Hedenfalk, Ingrid (Ingrid.Hedenfalk@med.lu.se)									International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology		2014	AUG 2014	53		526-535	526	535							Breast cancer is the most common cancer form in women and it has been extensively studied on the molecular level. Male breast cancer (MBC), on the other hand, is rare and has not been thoroughly investigated in terms of transcriptional profiles or genomic aberrations. Most of our understanding of MBC has therefore been extrapolated from knowledge of female breast cancer. Although differences in addition to similarities with female breast cancer have been reported, the same prognostic and predictive markers are used to determine optimal management strategies for both men and women diagnosed with breast cancer. This review is focused on prognosis for MBC patients, prognostic and predictive factors and molecular subgrouping; comparisons are made with female breast cancer. Information was collected from relevant literature on both male and female breast cancer from the MEDLINE database between 1992 and 2014.MBC is a heterogeneous disease, and on the molecular level many differences compared to female breast cancer have recently been revealed. Two distinct subgroups of MBC, luminal M1 and luminal M2, have been identified which differ from the well-established intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer in women. These novel subgroups of breast cancer therefore appear unique to MBC. Furthermore, several studies report inferior survival for men diagnosed with breast cancer compared to women. New promising prognostic biomarkers for MBC (e.g. NAT1) deserving further attention are reviewed. Further prospective studies aimed at validating the novel subgroups and recently proposed biomarkers for MBC are warranted to provide the basis for optimal patient management in this era of personalized medicine.

Using North-Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt) as an example, we document the magnitude and explore possible explanations for such patterns. Articles and reports published since the seventies were reviewed.Results show that breast cancer incidence in females is 2-4 times lower in North-Africa than in Western countries while incidence in males is similar. Consequently, the relative proportion of male breast cancer. is high (approximate to 2% of all breast cancers). Similarly, the incidence of aggressive forms of the disease, like inflammatory or triple negative breast cancer (in females), is not higher in North Africa than in Western countries, but their relative proportion in case series (up to 10% for inflammatory and 15-25% for triple negative) is significantly higher because of low incidence of other forms of the disease.In North Africa, the incidence among women aged 15-49 is lower than in Western countries, but the very low incidence among women aged more than 50, combined to the young age pyramid of North-Africa, makes the relative proportions of young patients substantially higher (50-60% versus 20% in France).Such epidemiological features result mainly from peculiar risk factor profiles, which are typical for many developing countries and include notably rapid changes in reproductive behaviours. These features have important implications for breast cancer control and treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The lumps are easier to invade in the center and the majority of the cases are positive for metastatic lymph node, with the typical clinical manifestation as a painless mass in partial breast. MBC with an unknown primary tumor is rare and is often prone to misdiagnosis, resulting in a delay in correct treatment. Such a case is extremely significant for clinical reference. The current study presents a 58-year-old male who developed a painless mass in the left armpit and received armpit mass biopsy and pathological examination which showed glandular cancer, with a high possibility of mammary primary tumor. The patient was administered four cycles of paclitaxel plus oxaliplatin chemotherapy. However, three months later, the patient identified novel disseminated lymph nodes in the left armpit. The initial pathological section and paraffin blocks were re-examined and the patient was finally diagnosed with breast invasive ductal carcinoma based on the metastases pathology and immunohistochemical examination. No breast mass was found on physical examination of the patient and the tumor markers, including cancer antigen 125 and carcinoembryonic antigen, were normal. No primary tumors were observed in the mammography and PET-CT and the primary tumor was not found following the left breast modified radical mastectomy.														1792-1074	1792-1082	10.3892/ol.2014.2111

(jim.wittliff@louisville.edu)									Breast		2014	JUN 2014	23	3	226-233	226	233							Breast carcinomas in both genders share pathological features, although differences in incidence, prognosis and survival are reported. Expression of 33 genes was investigated in male and female breast carcinomas in association with ER, PR, HER-2/neu and EGF-receptor. Among 98 male breast cancers, 82 were ER+ and 78 were PR+. ER and PR protein levels were greater in males compared to females, although no differences were observed in ESR1 and PGR expression. A difference was observed in binding affinities of PR but not ER between genders. No differences were observed in HER-2/neu, EGFR protein, or patient age. Expression of NAT1, TBC1D9, IL6ST, RABEP1, PLK1 and LRBA was elevated in carcinomas of males compared to those of females, in which ER status appeared to be related to expression. Overexpression of protein products of these genes represents novel molecular targets for development of gender-specific therapeutics and companion diagnostics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Radiation Research		2014	MAY 2014	181	5	471-484	471	484							Methods were developed to calculate individual estimates of exposure and dose with associated uncertainties for a sub-cohort (1,857) of 115,329 military veterans who participated in at least one of seven series of atmospheric nuclear weapons tests or the TRINITY shot carried out by the United States. The tests were conducted at the Pacific Proving Grounds and the Nevada Test Site. Dose estimates to specific organs will be used in an epidemiological study to investigate leukemia and male breast cancer. Previous doses had been estimated for the purpose of compensation and were generally high-sided to favor the veteran's claim for compensation in accordance with public law. Recent efforts by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to digitize the historical records supporting the veterans' compensation assessments make it possible to calculate doses and associated uncertainties. Our approach builds upon available film badge dosimetry and other measurement data recorded at the time of the tests and incorporates detailed scenarios of exposure for each veteran based on personal, unit, and other available historical records. Film badge results were available for approximately 25% of the individuals, and these results assisted greatly in reconstructing doses to unbadged persons and in developing distributions of dose among military units. This article presents the methodology developed to estimate doses for selected cancer cases and a 1% random sample of the total cohort of veterans under study.

British Journal of Cancer		2014	APR 2 2014	110	7	1891-1897	1891	1897							Background: The age-standardised incidence of breast cancer varies geographically, with rates in the highest-risk countries more than five times those in the lowest-risk countries.Methods: We investigated the correlation between male (MBC) and female breast cancer (FBC) incidence stratified by female age-group (<50 years, and >= 50 years) and used Poisson regression to examine male incidence rate ratios according to female incidence rates.Results: Age-adjusted breast cancer incidence rates for males and females share a similar geographic distribution (Spearman's correlation = 0.51; P <0.0001). A correlation with male incidence rates was found for the entire female population and for women aged 50 years and over. Breast cancer incidence rates in males aged <50 years were not associated with FBC incidence, whereas those in males aged >= 50 years were. MBC incidence displays a small `hook' similar to the Clemmesen's hook for FBC, but at a later age than the female hook.Interpretation: Further investigation of possible explanations for these patterns is warranted. Although the incidence of breast cancer is much lower in men than in women, it may be possible to identify a cause common to both men and women.

(author@drrath.com)									International Journal of Oncology		2014	MAR 2014	44	3	986-992	986	992							Strong clinical and experimental evidence demonstrates association of elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 with cancer progression, metastasis and shortened patient survival, as it plays a key role in tumor cell invasion and metastasis by digesting the basement membrane and ECM components. MMP-9 is secreted in both the monomeric and dimeric form. Although there is little research on MMP-9 dimers, some studies have shown the dimer to be associated with more aggressive tumor progression. Our objective was to study the relative secretion patterns of MMP-9 monomer and dimer in a variety of cancer cell lines and the effect of a nutrient mixture (NM) containing lysine, proline, ascorbic acid and green tea extract on MMP-9 secretion. The cancer cell lines were grown in their respective media, supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mu g/ml) in 24-well tissue culture plates. At near confluence, the cells were treated with NM at 0,10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 mu g/ml. Parallel sets of cultures were treated with PMA (100 ng/ml) for induction of MMP-9. Cell MMP-9 secretion was assayed by gelatinase zymography. MMP-9 dimer secretion patterns of cancer cells fell into different categories. We observed no MMP-9 dimer in prostate DU-145 and PC-3, pancreatic MIA-Pa-Ca2, colon HCT-116, bladder T-24, head and neck FaDu, glioblastoma A-172, T-98 and LN-18 and leukemia HL-60, Jurkat, and Raji cell lines. MMP-dimer secretion only with PMA induction was seen in breast MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, uterine SK-UT-1, lung A-549, tongue SC-25, melanoma A2058, osteosarcoma U-2OS, rhabdomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma HT-1080, chondrosarcoma SW-1350 and liposarcoma SW-872. Cervical HeLa and DoTc 2 4510, renal 786-0 and HCC SK-Hep-1 cells exhibited MMP-9 dimer without PMA treatment and increased secretion with PMA treatment. Sarcomas had the highest levels of MMP-9 monomer and dimer with and without PMA among these cancer cell lines. Cervical, uterine and male breast cancer cell lines showed the next highest levels of MMP-9, followed by breast cancer cell lines. Melanoma, renal, lung, head and neck and HCC showed lower levels and prostate, glioblastoma, bladder and leukemia cell lines the lowest. NM showed dose-dependent inhibition of MMP-9 monomer and dimer in all cell lines tested. In conclusion, high MMP-9 and dimer secretion levels correlated with the most aggressive cancer cell lines. NM was effective in inhibiting MMP-9 and dimer secretion in all cell lines tested, suggesting its therapeutic potential as an antimetastatic agent.														1019-6439	1791-2423	10.3892/ijo.2013.2235

European Rare Canc Study Grp								JNCI-Journal of the National Cancer Institute		2014	MAR 2014	106	3	Article No.: djt465	djt465								The etiology of male breast cancer is poorly understood, partly because of its relative rarity. Although genetic factors are involved, less is known regarding the role of anthropometric and hormonally related risk factors.In the Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project, a consortium of 11 casecontrol and 10 cohort investigations involving 2405 case patients (n 1190 from casecontrol and n 1215 from cohort studies) and 52013 control subjects, individual participant data were harmonized and pooled. Unconditional logistic regression generated study designspecific (casecontrol/cohort) odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with exposure estimates combined using fixed effects meta-analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.Risk was statistically significantly associated with weight (highest/lowest tertile: OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.57), height (OR 1.18; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.38), and body mass index (BMI; OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.51), with evidence that recent rather than distant BMI was the strongest predictor. Klinefelter syndrome (OR 24.7; 95% CI 8.94 to 68.4) and gynecomastia (OR 9.78; 95% CI 7.52 to 12.7) were also statistically significantly associated with risk, relations that were independent of BMI. Diabetes also emerged as an independent risk factor (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.37). There were also suggestive relations with cryptorchidism (OR 2.18; 95% CI 0.96 to 4.94) and orchitis (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.99). Although age at onset of puberty and histories of infertility were unrelated to risk, never having had children was statistically significantly related (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.66). Among individuals diagnosed at older ages, a history of fractures was statistically significantly related (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.86).Consistent findings across casecontrol and cohort investigations, complemented by pooled analyses, indicated important roles for anthropometric and hormonal risk factors in the etiology of male breast cancer. Further investigation should focus on potential roles of endogenous hormones.

Iss. SI	1291-1294	1291	1294							Background: Breast cancer (BC) in males is a rare disease and comprises 0.5-1% of all BC cases. Due to its rarity, there are limited data regarding risk factors, biology and relevant treatment. Aim: A prospective observational study of demographic, clinical and histological characteristics of serially-admitted men with breast cancer was carried out from 1999 to 2009. Patients and Methods: Data were recorded and analyzed from a database including 1,315 cases of BC. Registered data concerned age, initial presentation, family and lifestyle history (risk factors), histological features, phenotypic subtypes and TNM staging. Results: Twenty two men with BC were identified, with a median age of 63 years. The most common initial presentation was a palpable lump in 12 patients, nipple contraction in three and ulceration in three. According to their medical history, nine men were overweight, 10 suffered from hypertension and 12 were smokers. The most prevalent phenotype was luminal-A followed by triple-negative type. BC in none of the cases was HER 2-amplified. The majority of cases were grade II or III and stage II or III. Conclusion: In the present small study, we confirm that BC in males is rare. It is a disease of middle-age and presents at advanced stages. Most of patients had 1-3 risk factors for BC. Expression of hormonal receptors occurs in the majority of BC tumors in males and with rarity in HER 2 amplification.														0250-7005	1791-7530

Oncology (Basel)		2014		87	1	1-6	1	6							Objective: The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay has been widely adopted for use in early estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer to assess the risk for distant recurrence and the potential benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary aim of this study was to assess RS distribution in Israeli male breast cancer (MBC) patients. Methods: The study population included 65 newly diagnosed Israeli MBC patients. Clinical and pathologic data were collected at the time of referral. Pathologic examinations were conducted at the pathology departments of the referring centers. The RS assay (Oncotype DX (TM)) was performed on paraffin-embedded tumor samples at Genomic Health laboratories. Results: The mean age of the patients was 65.1 years (range 38-88 years). Low-risk (RS <18), intermediate-risk (RS 18-30) and high-risk (RS >= 31) scores were noted in 29 patients (44.6%), 27 patients (41.5%) and 9 patients (13.9%), respectively. The distribution of RS in male patients was similar to the distribution in 2,455 female patients from Israel referred during the same time period. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the distribution of Oncotype DX RS in ER-positive MBC patients is similar to that of female breast cancer patients. (C) 2014 S.

Neoplasma (Bratislava)		2014		61	3	331-339	331	339							Male breast cancer is a rare form of carcinoma with an incidence rate of approximately 0.5-1% compared with cases of breast carcinoma as a whole. Male breast cancer reacts effectively to endocrine therapy because of a high frequency of hormone receptor expression.The aim of the present study was the assessment of correlations between stage, grade, expression of steroid receptors, basal/mesenchymal markers and proliferation index, as well as analysis of the impact of the above-mentioned parameters on overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in the group of 32 male breast cancer patients, treated at the Centre of Oncology in Cracow.We showed the significant positive correlation between MIB-1 LI and tumor stage, and hormone receptors (ER or PgR) immunonegativity, and expression of EGFR, vimentin (p<0.05) and P-cadherin (the last at statistical border). The presence of any of basal or masenchymal markers correlated with a more advanced tumor stage. Moreover tumors without vimentin expression were characterised by lower MIB-1 LI and were more frequently EGFR immunonegative.We found that hormone receptor negativity, vimentin immunopositivity and high MIB-1 LI are significant independent indicators of poor OS and DFS for male breast cancer patients (p<0.05).														0028-2685		10.4149/neo_2014_043

This study evaluated the presence of ducts showing columnar cell-like features in the male breast.Methods Seventy-one consecutive surgical resections from men (6 invasive breast carcinoma of grade 3, 1 atypical ductal hyperplasia and 64 other lesions) were reviewed to identify foci of dilated ducts with columnar epithelial cells, and their morphological features including apical snouts, intraluminal secretions and calcifications were assessed. The expression of CK5/6 and estrogen receptor (ER) was evaluated immunohistochemically. Clinicopathological features including patients' age, histological diagnosis and gynaecomastoid hyperplasia were documented.Results Ducts showing columnar cell-like features were identified in 39 cases, morphologically as distended ducts with round or undulating outline. There was an outer layer of myoepithelial cells and an inner layer of columnar luminal cells showing apical snouts, but without intraluminal secretions or calcifications. Immunohistochemically, these columnar epithelial cells were negative for CK5/6 in 38/39 cases and all were ER heterogeneously positive. These changes were associated with older age, but their incidence did not differ whether they were associated with invasive breast carcinoma, atypical ductal hyperplasia and other lesions.Conclusions In the male breast, there is an entity sharing morphological features and immunohistochemical profile of columnar cell lesions.														0021-9746	1472-4146	10.1136/jclinpath-2013-201631

In 2012, 130 men in Ukraine got breast cancer that constituted 0.74% from all patients with mentioned pathology detected in the course of year. E'very year in Ukraine approximately 100 men die from breast cancer. Still many aspects of male breast cancer remain unstudied. It occurs since information about mentioned disease is mainly based on retrospective analysis of small groups. Treatment of men, who got breast cancer, is based on knowledge, which has been obtained in treatment of women vvith this pathology. This article is based on the results of analysis of 168 cases of breast cancer in men, who have been examined and treated in the period from 1956 to 2012. In paper the peculiarities of clinical manifestations of male breast cancer have been determined, the optimal volume of diagnostic procedures in men with suspicion of breast cancer has been established, the manunographic signs have been detected and the possible histological variants of disease have been determined, clinical cmffse peculiarities of male breast cancer have been defmed, the most essential factors of prognosis of the disease have been fixed. Furthermore, in article optimal volume of surgical treatment of male breast cancer has been substantiated, the role and place of radiotherapy in treatment of this pathology has been determined. It has been proved that adjuvant polychemotherapy should be applied to the patients with male breast cancer independently from stage of process. Also optimal schemes of this kind of treatment have been determined. The efficacy of hormonal therapy vvith antiestrogen in patients with positive receptors of steroid hormones and at presence of unfavorable prognostic factors of disease has been demonstrated. Die inefficiency of orchiectomy as one of the widespread kinds of hormonal therapy of male breast cancer has been defined.														1812-9269

In female breast cancer tumors with chromosome 17 centromere (CEP17) duplication, HER2 and/or Topoisomerase II alpha (Topo II-alpha) gene alterations have been suggested to be associated with poor prognosis and increased sensitivity to anthracycline-containing regimens.In a well characterized cohort of 96 primary invasive MBC, we studied CEP17, HER2 and Topo II-alpha alterations by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and expression of hormone receptors (HR), HER2 and Ki67 by immunohistochemistry to define molecular subtypes. Tumor characteristics and follow-up data were available and correlated with molecular findings.HER2 amplification and Topo II-alpha amplification/deletion were exceptionally rare in MBC (6.3% and 3.1%, respectively). CEP17 polysomy were found in 9.4% of tumors. HER2, Topo II-alpha and CEP17 gene alterations were not correlated to patients outcome. 96.9% of our cases were HR positive. Triple negative tumors were found in only 3.1% of the cases. In nodal negative tumors luminal A subtypes were significantly associated with better overall survival.Our results provide evidence for a predominant male breast cancer phenotype, characterized by HR expression and a lack of HER2/Topo II-alpha alterations and CEP17 duplicates. Therefore, the impact of anthracycline sensitivity linked to HER2/Topo II-alpha alterations as found in female breast cancer has low clinical significance for this specific male breast cancer phenotype.

With the strict use of the criteria based on cancer family history 173 BRCA (21.9%) mutations would have been detected in 789 individuals. At the commonly used 10% threshold of BRCA mutation carrier probability, the genetic models showed a similar performance [PPV (38% and 37%), sensitivity (76% and 77%) and specificity (70% and 69%)]. Their strict use would have avoided around 60% of the tests but would have missed approximately 1 every 4 carriers.Conclusion: Our data highlight the complexity of BRCA testing referral in routine practice and question the strict use of genetic models for BRCA risk assessment.

(emma.fields@ucdenver.edu) ; DeWitt, Peter; Fisher, Christine M.; Rabinovitch, Rachel									International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics		2013	NOV 15 2013	87	4	747-752	747	752							Purpose: To analyze the stage-specific management of male breast cancer (MBC) with surgery and radiation therapy (RT) and relate them to outcomes and to female breast cancer (FBC).Methods and Materials: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for all primary invasive MBC and FBC diagnosed from 1973 to 2008. Analyzable data included age, race, registry, grade, stage, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, type of surgery, and use of RT. Stage was defined as localized (LocD): confined to the breast; regional (RegD): involving skin, chest wall, and/or regional lymph nodes; and distant: M1. The primary endpoint was cause-specific survival (CSS).Results: A total of 4276 cases of MBC and 718,587 cases of FBC were identified. Male breast cancer constituted 0.6% of all breast cancer. Comparing MBC with FBC, mastectomy (M) was used in 87.4% versus 38.3%, and breast-conserving surgery in 12.6% versus 52.6% (P<10(-4)). For males with LocD, CSS was not significantly different for the 4.6% treated with lumpectomy/RT versus the 70% treated with M alone (hazard ratio [HR] 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-3.61; P=.57). Postmastectomy RT was delivered in 33% of males with RegD and was not associated with an improvement in CSS (HR 1.11; 95% CI 0.88-1.41; P=.37). There was a significant increase in the use of postmastectomy RT in MBC over time: 24.3%, 27.2%, and 36.8% for 1973-1987, 1988-1997, and 1998-2008, respectively (P<.0001). Cause-specific survival for MBC has improved: the largest significant change was identified for men diagnosed in 1998-2008 compared with 1973-1987 (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.60-0.88; P=.0004).Conclusions: Surgical management of MBC is dramatically different than for FBC. The majority of males with LocD receive M despite equivalent CSS with lumpectomy/RT. Postmastectomy RT is greatly underutilized in MBC with RegD, although a CSS benefit was not demonstrated. Outcomes for MBC are improving, attributable to improved therapy and its use in this unscreened population. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

(p.j.vandiest@umcutrecht.nl)									Modern Pathology		2013	NOV 2013	26	11	1461-1467	1461	1467							Gene copy number changes have an important role in carcinogenesis and could serve as potential biomarkers for prognosis and targets for therapy. Copy number changes mapping to chromosome 16 have been reported to be the most frequent alteration observed in female breast cancer and a loss on 16q has been shown to be associated with low grade and better prognosis. In the present study, we aimed to characterize copy number changes on 16q in a group of 135 male breast cancers using a novel multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification kit. One hundred and twelve out of 135 (83%) male breast cancer showed copy number changes of at least one gene on chromosome 16, with frequent loss of 16q (71/135; 53%), either partial (66/135; 49%) or whole arm loss (5/135; 4%). Losses on 16q were thereby less often seen in male breast cancer than previously described in female breast cancer. Loss on 16q was significantly correlated with favorable clinicopathological features such as negative lymph node status, small tumor size, and low grade. Copy number gain of almost all genes on the short arm was also significantly correlated with lymph node negative status. A combination of 16q loss and 16p gain correlated even stronger with negative lymph node status (n = 112; P = 0.012), which was also underlined by unsupervised clustering. In conclusion, copy number loss on 16q is less frequent in male breast cancer than in female breast cancer, providing further evidence that male breast cancer and female breast cancer are genetically different. Gain on 16p and loss of 16q identify a group of male breast cancer with low propensity to develop lymph node metastases.

Cases required a primary breast cancer diagnosis (ICD-9-CM 175. x) on 2 different dates and a procedural code for mastectomy or lumpectomy/partial mastectomy with evidence of continuous care (radiation/chemotherapy or diagnoses in 2 or more months). Eligible controls were within 5 years in age and had duration of prior health care enrollment within 6 weeks. Risk set sampling selected 20 controls per case. We assessed the rate ratio for male breast cancer with 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor exposure using conditional logistic regression. Analyses were stratified by duration of health care enrollment before diagnosis (1 year or more, 2 years or more and 3 years or more), each incremental 180 and 365 days of cumulative 5a-reductase inhibitor exposure, and period specific time frames before diagnosis (years 1, 2 and 3).Results: We identified 339 breast cancer cases matched to 6,780 controls. No statistically significant associations were observed between 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors and breast cancer regardless of exposure assessment before the index date (1 year or moredRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.34-1.45; 2 years or moredRR 0.59, 95% CI 0.24-1.48; or 3 years or moredRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.27-2.10). Each subsequent 180 days (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.67-1.53) and 365 days (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.45-2.37) of cumulative 5a-reductase inhibitor therapy and period specific rate ratios also showed null associations.Conclusions: The lack of an association in our study suggests that the development of breast cancer should not influence the prescribing of 5a-reductase inhibitor therapy.

(edward@ece.tamu.edu)									Pattern Recognition		2013	NOV 2013	46	11	3017-3029	3017	3029							This paper provides exact analytical expressions for the first and second moments of the true error for linear discriminant analysis (LDA) when the data are univariate and taken from two stochastic Gaussian processes. The key point is that we assume a general setting in which the sample data from each class do not need to be identically distributed or independent within or between classes. We compare the true errors of designed classifiers under the typical i.i.d. model and when the data are correlated, providing exact expressions and demonstrating that, depending on the covariance structure, correlated data can result in classifiers with either greater error or less error than when training with uncorrelated data. The general theory is applied to autoregressive and moving-average models of the first order, and it is demonstrated using real genomic data. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

With the objective to identify genes of importance for breast tumorigenesis in men and to enable comparisons with genes important for breast cancer development in women, we applied the computational framework COpy Number and EXpression In Cancer (CONEXIC) to detect candidate driver genes among all altered passenger genes. Unique to this approach is that each driver gene is associated with several gene modules that are believed to be altered by the driver. Thirty candidate drivers were found in the male breast cancers and 67 in the female breast cancers. We identified many known drivers of breast cancer and other types of cancer, in the female dataset (e. g. GATA3, CCNE1, GRB7, CDK4). In contrast, only three known cancer genes were found among male breast cancers; MAP2K4, LHP, and ZNF217. Many of the candidate drivers identified are known to be involved in processes associated with tumorigenesis, including proliferation, invasion and differentiation. One of the modules identified in male breast cancer was regulated by THY1, a gene involved in invasion and related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, men with THY1 positive breast cancers had significantly inferior survival. THY1 may thus be a promising novel prognostic marker for male breast cancer. Another module identified among male breast cancers, regulated by SPAG5, was closely associated with proliferation. Our data indicate that male and female breast cancers display highly different landscapes of candidate driver genes, as only a few genes were found in common between the two. Consequently, the pathobiology of male breast cancer may differ from that of female breast cancer and can be associated with differences in prognosis; men diagnosed with breast cancer may consequently require different management and treatment strategies than women.

Indian Journal of Cancer		2013	OCT-DEC 2013	50	4	297-301	297	301							BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the Indian female population. As per our hospital data, breast cancer is also found to be the second leading malignancy in women. Hence, we undertook this study to evaluate the clinical profile, histopathologic types, grade, stage and the prognosis of the disease in our patients. Majority of our patients are from rural areas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was undertaken over a period of three years comprising of 178 patients who underwent modified radical mastectomy following preliminary diagnosis of carcinoma on fine needle aspiration cytology or histopathological examination of the lumpectomy or trucut biopsy specimens. Clinico-pathological evaluation was done in all of these cases following standard protocols. RESULT: The study comprised of 175 female patients and 3 male patients in the age range of 28 to 76 years. Majority (111/62.3%) of the cases were within the age range of 31-50 years of age with mean age of 48.7 years. Two females had bilateral breast cancer and one female had synchronous papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary. Invasive ductal carcinoma no special type was the most common histopathologic pattern, and was seen in 172 (95.5%) cases. Most tumors were Scarff Bloom Richardson grade II and American Joint Committee on Cancer pathologic stage II. Prognostically, majority of tumors (49.5%) was assessed as 'good' as per the Nottingham prognostic index score. CONCLUSIONS: This study gave an insight to the clinico-pathological profile of breast cancer in our area. Long term study with follow up of the patient is needed for better understanding of the case.														0019-509X	1998-4774	10.4103/0019-509X.123594

Each male breast cancer patient recorded in the database was matched with two female breast cancer patients of equal stage. Prognosis in terms of disease-free survival and overall survival was evaluated.The mean age at diagnosis was 58.6 9.7 years for males and 57.2 10.3 years for females. The median follow-up was 69 months for males and 81 months for females. Significant differences were identified for tumor location, hormone receptor status, molecular subtypes and hormone therapy between the two groups. Monofactorial analysis demonstrated that tumor size, lymph node state, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, molecular subtypes and adjuvant chemotherapy treatment were prognostic factors in male breast cancer patients. The 5- and 10-year disease-free survival rates were 65.6 and 40.1 for males, and 74.9 and 51.5 for females, respectively. The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 72.9 and 53.9 for males, and 83.2 and 68.5 for females, respectively. There was significantly difference in disease-free survival and overall survival between the two matched groups (P 0.002).Male breast cancer patients had inferior outcome despite of equal stage in comparison with matched female breast cancer patients, which demonstrates that biological differences may contribute to the worse prognosis.														0368-2811	1465-3621	10.1093/jjco/hyt116

We aim to study the impact of molecular subtype on the prognosis of MBC.Methods: We identified MBC cases from 1990 to 2011 retrospectively; molecular subtype was assigned by immunohistochemistry. We compared overall survival in different subtypes by Kaplan-Meier method and COX proportional hazard regression model.Results: 68 patients with MBC were included in analysis with 115 months of a median follow-up time. Comparing to non-luminal A (subtypes of Luminal B, HER2 over-express and Basal-like) group, patients with luminal A had a lower recurrent rate and better overall survival (10-year survival rate was 78.0% vs 67.0%, mean survival time 197.46 +/- 12.22 months vs 146.51 +/- 16.88 months, p < 0.05).Conclusion: Molecular subtype may have prognosis-predicting value for MBC.

To investigate the potential relationship between urinary PE levels and idiopathic male infertility and semen quality in Chinese adult males, 608 idiopathic infertile men and 469 fertile controls were recruited by eligibility screening procedures. Individual exposure to PEs was measured using UPLC-MS/MS as spot urinary concentrations of 6 PEs (daidzein, DAI; equol, EQU; genistein, GEN; naringenin, NAR; coumestrol, COU; and secoisolariciresinol, SEC), which were adjusted with urinary creatinine (CR).

We found that exposures to DAI, GEN and SEC were significantly associated with idiopathic male infertility (P-value for trend = 0.036; 0.002; and 0.0001, respectively), while these exposures had stronger association with infertile subjects with at least one abnormal semen parameter than those with all normal semen parameters. Exposures to DAI, GEN and SEC were also related to idiopathic male infertility with abnormal sperm concentration, number per ejaculum and motility (P-value for trend < 0.05), while these exposures had stronger association with the infertile men with abnormal sperm number per ejaculum. These findings provide the evidence that PE exposures are related to male reproductive function and raise a public health concern because that exposure to PEs is ubiquitous in China.

(tnguyen@vet.k-state.edu)									PLoS One		2013	JUN 3 2013	8	6	Article No.: e64866	e64866								Male breast cancer is a rare disease. The limited number of clinical cases has led to the primary treatments for men being derived from female breast cancer studies. Here the transgenic strain FVB/N-Tg(MMTV-PyVT)634Mul/J ( also known as PyVT) was used as a model system for measuring tumor burden and drug sensitivity of the antineoplastic drugs tamoxifen, cisplatin, and paclitaxel on tumorigenesis at an early stage of mammary carcinoma development in a male mouse model. Cisplatin treatment significantly reduced tumor volume, while paclitaxel and tamoxifen did not attenuate tumor growth. Cisplatin treatment was shown to induce apoptosis, grossly observed by reduced tumor formation, through reduced Bcl-2 and survivin protein expression levels with an increase in caspase 3 expression compared to control tumors. Tamoxifen treatment significantly altered the hormone receptor expression levels of the tumor, while additionally upregulating Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1. This suggests an importance in hormonal signaling in male breast cancer pathogenesis. The results of this study provide valuable information toward the better understanding of male breast cancer and may help guide treatment decisions.

Due to its rarity, male axillary breast cancer is easy to misdiagnose. As for adenocarcinoma in the axilla, it is difficult to identify whether the origin is the mammary tissue or the skin appendages, particularly in cases where there is a poor differentiation. The present study reports the case of a male patient with a right axillary lesion that had been present for 6 months. A histological evaluation revealed the features of a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma with regards to the pathological report. The patient was diagnosed with a metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown primary origin. However, following 4 cycles of intensive chemotherapy, the patient experienced bone metastasis while the local lesion was in partial remission. Further immunohistochemistry confirmed its mammary origin. There is limited literature relating to male ectopic axillary breast cancer, and a high probability of misdiagnosis of this disease.														1792-1074	1792-1082	10.3892/ol.2013.1300

The study aims to assess the efficacy of triple assessment as part of an age related protocol currently used in the clinical setting.1141 referrals between 01.01.01 and 31.12.09 were evaluated. Patient age ranged from 29 to 89 years. Mammography (M) was performed in men >= 35years. Sensitivity for clinical examination (CE) was 64.0%, M 77.8%, US 92.0%. 25 cancers were diagnosed, 24 aged >40years, 1 aged 29. 2 presented with nipple discharge. The cancer <40years was diagnosed with CE and US, all others had suspicious CE and/or M necessitating US and biopsy.We suggest a protocol incorporating mammography in men >40years would capture all cancers. Combined specificities approaching 100% suggest men >40 years scored benign after CE and M warrant no further assessment. Bloody nipple discharge is a suspicious sign and the reassurance of non-bloody discharge should be treated with caution.

Patients and Methods: Charts for men and women diagnosed with breast cancer referred to the London Regional Cancer Program (LRCP) were reviewed. Patients with distant metastatic diseases were excluded. Data on prognostic factors including age, nodal status, resection margin, use of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy with/without hormone and radiation therapy (RT), overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed. Survival estimates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier methodology. The Cox regression interaction was used to compare male and female differences in prognostic factors. Results: From 1963-2006 there were 75 cases of MBC and 1,313 of FBC totaling in 1,388 breast cancer cases. The median age of the cohort was 53 (range=23-90) years. The median follow-up was 90 (range=0.4-339) months. Of the prognostic factors considered, nodal status had a significant Cox regression interaction. For OS, p=0.001 with hazard ratios of 0.83 (95% confidence interval CI=0.42-1.64) and 2.88 (95% CI-2.36-3.52) for males and females, respectively. For CSS p=0.041 with hazard ratios of 1.22 (95% CI=0.45-3.27) and 3.52 (95% CI=2.76-4.48) for males and females, respectively. For node-positive cases, distant disease recurrence-free survival was worse for MBC (log rank, p<0.001). Conclusion: This large series showed that the nodal status influences survival differently in MBC and FBC. The findings of this study need confirmation from a more complete prospective database and further investigations on improving high-risk node-positive MBC management are warranted.														0250-7005	1791-7530

Interestingly, the metabolic activity of SULT1A1 can be affected by variations in gene copy number. Male Breast Cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and less investigated disease compared to female BC (FBC). As in FBC, the concurrent effects of genetic risk factors, particularly BRCA2 mutations, increased exposure to estrogens and environmental carcinogens play a relevant role in MBC. By quantitative real-time PCR with TaqMan probes, we investigated the presence of SULT1A1 gene copy number variations (CNVs) in a series of 72 MBCs. SULT1A1 gene deletion was observed in 10 of the 72 MBCs (13.9%). In a multivariate analysis association between BRCA2 mutation and SULT1A1 gene deletion emerged (p=0.0005). Based on the evidence that the level of SULT1A1 enzyme activity is correlated with CNV, our data suggest that in male breast tumors SULT1A1 activity may be decreased. Thus, it can be hypothesized that in a proportion of MBCs, particularly in BRCA2-associated MBCs, the level of estrogens and environmental carcinogens exposure might be increased suggesting a link between gene and environmental exposure in the pathogenesis of MBC.

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2013	MAY 2013	139	1	177-182	177	182							Lumpectomy is performed in a small but growing proportion of men with breast cancer. It is unknown whether men undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) receive care compliant with breast cancer treatment guidelines. Patients with breast cancer in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database who underwent lumpectomy between 1983 and 2009 were identified. Gender differences in the receipt of lymph node staging and adjuvant radiation therapy were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to evaluate the independent association of gender on these outcomes. The influence of gender on breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) was analyzed. 382,030 of 824,408 (46.3 %) women compared to 712 of 6,039 (11.8 %) men with breast cancer underwent lumpectomy. Men were older, more likely to be black, less likely to have stage I disease and more likely to have stage IV disease. Only 59.2 % of men had lymph nodes sampled at the time of surgery compared to 81.6 % of women (p < 0.0001). In addition, only 35.4 % of men received adjuvant breast radiation therapy compared to 69.8 % of women (p < 0.0001). After controlling for age, race, stage, grade, and year of diagnosis, female gender was significantly associated with receiving adjuvant radiation therapy (OR 2.9, 95 % CI 2.4-3.4) and lymph node staging (OR 1.6, 95 % CI 1.3-1.90). Five- and ten-year BCSS were 88.0 and 83.5 % for men compared to 93.2 and 88.2 % for women (p < 0.001). Men with breast cancer are less likely to receive lymph node staging or adjuvant radiation therapy following BCS compared to women.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-013-2517-y

(sgiordan@mdanderson.org)									Cancer		2013	MAY 1 2013	119	9	1611-1617	1611	1617							BACKGROUND: Breast cancer occurs rarely in men. To the authors' knowledge, no population-based estimates of the incidence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer or of the distribution of breast cancer subtypes among male breast cancer patients have been published to date. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to explore breast tumor subtype distribution by race/ethnicity among men in the large, ethnically diverse population of California. METHODS: This study included men who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2005 and 2009 with known estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) (together, hormone receptor [HR]) status and HER2 status reported to the California Cancer Registry. Among the men with HR-positive tumors, survival probabilities between groups were compared using log-rank tests. RESULTS: Six hundred six patients were included. The median age at diagnosis was 68 years. Four hundred ninety-four men (81.5%) had HR-positive tumors (defined as ER-positive and/or PR-positive and HER2-negative). Ninety men (14.9%) had HER2-positive tumors, and 22 (3.6%) had triple receptor-negative (TN) tumors. Among the patients with HR-positive tumors, non-Hispanic black men and Hispanic men were more likely to have PR-negative tumors than non-Hispanic white men. No statistically significant differences in survival were observed according to tumor subtype (P = .08). Differences in survival according to race/ethnicity were observed among all patients (P = .087) and among those with HR-positive tumors (P = .0170), and non-Hispanic black men had poorer outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, representative cohort of men with breast cancer, the distribution of tumor subtypes was different from that reported for women and varied by patient race/ethnicity. Non-Hispanic black men were more likely to have TN tumors and ER-positive/PR-negative tumors than white men. Cancer 2013; 119: 1611-7. (C) 2013 American Cancer Society.

(michael.cook@nih.gov)									International Journal of Cancer		2013	APR 15 2013	132	8	1918-1926	1918	1926							Global international trends in female breast cancer incidence have been described previously but no comparable analysis of male breast cancer incidence rates has been conducted. We obtained male and female case and population data using Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5). We calculated age-adjusted, sex-specific incidence rates and female-to-male incidence rate ratios (FMIRRs) and compared trends of such for the period 19882002. This analysis included 8,681 male breast cancer cases and 1.14 million female breast cancer cases. The highest male incidence rate was observed in Israel at 1.24 per 100,000 man-years, and the highest female incidence rate was observed in the United States at 90.7 per 100,000 woman-years. The lowest incidence rates for males (0.16) and females (18.0) were observed in Thailand. In general, male breast cancer incidence trends were variable; a minority of countries displayed evidence for an increase. In contrast, female incidence rates have been increasing in a majority of countries. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) for male and female breast cancer incidence rates by country during 19882002 was 0.69. Male breast cancer rates were generally less than 1 per 100,000 man-years, in contrast to the much higher rates of female breast cancer, providing for an overall FMIRR of 122. The differences in both incidence rates and time trends between males and females may reflect sex differences in underlying risk factors, pathogenesis, and/or overdiagnosis. Conversely, the high correlation between male and female breast cancer incidences may indicate that both sexes share some common risk factors for breast cancer.

Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2013	APR 2013	138	3	861-868	861	868							It is well-known that male breast cancer (MBC) susceptibility is mainly due to high-penetrance BRCA1/2 mutations. Here, we investigated whether common low-penetrance breast cancer (BC) susceptibility alleles may influence MBC risk in Italian population and whether variant alleles may be associated with specific clinicopathological features of MBCs. In the frame of the Italian Multicenter Study on MBC, we genotyped 413 MBCs and 745 age-matched male controls at 9 SNPs annotating known BC susceptibility loci. By multivariate logistic regression models, we found a significant increased MBC risk for 3 SNPs, in particular, with codominant models, for rs2046210/ESR1 (OR = 1.71; 95 % CI: 1.43-2.05; p = 0.0001), rs3803662/TOX3 (OR = 1.59; 95 % CI: 1.32-1.92; p = 0.0001), and rs2981582/FGFR2 (OR = 1.26; 95 % CI: 1.05-1.50; p = 0.013). Furthermore, we showed that the prevalence of the risk genotypes of ESR1 tended to be higher in ER- tumors (p = 0.062). In a case-case multivariate analysis, a statistically significant association between ESR1 and ER- tumors was found (OR = 1.88; 95 % CI: 1.03-3.49; p = 0.039). Overall, our data, based on a large and well-characterized MBC series, support the hypothesis that common low-penetrance BC susceptibility alleles play a role in MBC susceptibility and, interestingly, indicate that ESR1 is associated with a distinct tumor subtype defined by ER-negative status.

(p.j.vandiest@umcutrecht.nl)									PLoS One		2013	APR 1 2013	8	4	Article No.: e60138	e60138								The incidence of male breast cancer (MBC) is rising. Current treatment regimens for MBC are extrapolated from female breast cancer (FBC), based on the assumption that FBC prognostic features and therapeutic targets can be extrapolated to MBC. However, there is yet little evidence that prognostic features that have been developed and established in FBC are applicable to MBC as well. In a recent study on FBC, a combination of mitotic index and Bcl2 expression proved to be of strong prognostic value. Previous papers on Bcl2 expression in MBC were equivocal, and the prognostic value of Bcl2 combined with mitotic index has not been studied in MBC. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the prognostic value of Bcl2 in combination with mitotic index in MBC. Immunohistochemical staining for Bcl2 was performed on tissue microarrays of a total of 151 male breast cancer cases. Mitotic index was scored. The prognostic value of Bcl2 expression and Bcl2/mitotic index combinations was evaluated studying their correlations with clinicopathologic features and their prediction of survival. The vast majority of MBC (94%) showed Bcl2 expression, more frequently than previously described for FBC. Bcl2 expression had no significant associations with clinicopathologic features such as tumor size, mitotic count and grade. In univariate survival analysis, Bcl2 had no prognostic value, and showed no additional prognostic value to tumor size and histological grade in Cox regression. In addition, the Bcl2/mitotic index combination as opposed to FBC did not predict survival in MBC. In conclusion, Bcl2 expression is common in MBC, but is not associated with major clinicopathologic features and, in contrast to FBC, does not seem to have prognostic value, also when combined with mitotic index.

It provides an overview of existing research limitations and uncertainties and the plausible etiologic risk factors associated with cancer in this understudied occupation. Methods Previous cancer studies among police officers were obtained via a systematic review of the MEDLINE, CABDirect, and Web of Science bibliographic databases. Results Quality observational studies of cancer among police officers are sparse and subject to limitations in exposure assessment and other methods. Results from three studies suggested possible increased mortality risks for all cancers, and cancers of the colon, kidney, digestive system, esophagus, male breast, and testis, as well as Hodgkin's disease. Few incidence studies have been performed, and results have been mixed, although some associations with police work have been observed for thyroid, skin, and male breast cancer. Conclusions Police are exposed to a mix of known or suspected agents or activities that increase cancer risk. Epidemiologic evidence to date is sparse and inconsistent. There is a critical need for more research to understand the biological and social processes underlying exposures and the suggested disproportionate risks and to identify effective prevention strategies.

(anthony.swerdlow@icr.ac.uk)									British Journal of Cancer		2013	MAR 5 2013	108	4	959-963	959	963							Background: In cultured, dividing transformed T lymphocytes and in dividing bone marrow cells from normal men and those with a haematological malignancy, sex chromosome aneuploidy has been found to increase in prevalence and degree with age. This has rarely been investigated in non-dividing uncultured blood samples. The loss and gain of the X chromosome in dividing transformed lymphocytes in women with age is much more frequent than that of the Y chromosome in males. However, paradoxically X chromosome aneuploidy is rarely seen in the dividing cells of bone marrow of females.Methods: In blood samples from 565 men with breast cancer and 54 control men from the England and Wales general population, 80 cell nuclei per sample were scored for presence of X and Y chromosomes using fluorescent centromeric probes.Results: Sex chromosome aneuploidy, largely Y chromosome loss, was present in 63% of cases and 57% of controls, with the prevalence and degree of aneuploidy increasingly sharply and highly significantly with age. At ages 65-80 years, 71% of cases and 85% of controls showed aneuploidy and 15% and 25%, respectively, had >= 10% of cells aneuploid. Allowing for age, aneuploidy was less prevalent (P=0.03) in cases than controls.Conclusion: Sex chromosome aneuploidy in non-dividing nuclei of peripheral blood cells is frequent in adult men, the prevalence and degree increasing sharply with age. The possible relation of sex chromosome aneuploidy to breast cancer risk in men, and to cancer risk generally, needs further investigation, ideally in cohort studies.														0007-0920	1532-1827	10.1038/bjc.2012.577

Methods: DNA samples of 94 breast cancer patients and 94 unrelated healthy control individuals with matched age and gender from the same geographical region of Punjab, North West India were screened for the -2549 I/D polymorphism. Serum VEGF-C (sVEGF-C) levels of breast cancer patients and healthy controls were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The frequency of the II, ID, and DD genotype was 23.40 versus 10.64%, 48.94 versus 52.13%, and 27.66 versus 37.23%, in patients and controls, respectively. A statistically significant difference was observed for genotype distribution among the patients and controls (chi(2) = 6.039, p = 0.049). There was a significant increase in the I allele frequency in the patients as compared with controls (47.86 versus 36.70%, p = 0.028). The sVEGF-C levels were also considerably higher in patients as compared to healthy controls (p < 0.01). Conclusions: The VEGF -2549 I/D polymorphism has a role in the susceptibility to breast cancer in the Amritsar region of Punjab, India.

J	BCI:BCI201300195259	23308200			Differential Expression of Growth Factor Receptors and Membrane-Bound Tumor Markers for Imaging in Male and Female Breast Cancer		Vermeulen, Jeroen F.; Kornegoor, Robert; van der Wall, Elsken; van der Groep, Petra; van Diest, Paul J. (p.j.vandiest@umcutrecht.nl)									PLoS One		2013	JAN 4 2013	8	1	Article No.: e53353	e53353								Introduction: Male breast cancer accounts for 0.5-1% of all breast cancers and is generally diagnosed at higher stage than female breast cancers and therefore might benefit from earlier detection and targeted therapy. Except for HER2 and EGFR, little is known about expression of growth factor receptors in male breast cancer. We therefore investigated expression profiles of growth factor receptors and membrane-bound tumor markers in male breast cancer and gynecomastia, in comparison with female breast cancer.Methods: Tissue microarrays containing 133 male breast cancer and 32 gynecomastia cases were stained by immunohistochemistry for a panel of membrane-bound targets and compared with data on 266 female breast cancers.Results: Growth factor receptors were variably expressed in 4.5% (MET) up to 38.5% (IGF1-R) of male breast cancers. Compared to female breast cancer, IGF1-R and carbonic anhydrase 12 (CAXII) were more frequently and CD44v6, MET and FGFR2 less frequently expressed in male breast cancer. Expression of EGFR, HER2, CAIX, and GLUT1 was not significantly different between male and female breast cancer. Further, 48.1% of male breast cancers expressed at least one and 18.0% expressed multiple growth factor receptors. Since individual membrane receptors are expressed in only half of male breast cancers, a panel of membrane markers will be required for molecular imaging strategies to reach sensitivity. A potential panel of markers for molecular imaging, consisting of EGFR, IGF1-R, FGFR2, CD44v6, CAXII, GLUT1, and CD44v6 was positive in 77% of male breast cancers, comparable to female breast cancers.Conclusions: Expression patterns of growth factor receptors and hypoxia membrane proteins in male breast cancer are different from female breast cancer. For molecular imaging strategies, a putative panel consisting of markers for EGFR, IGF1-R, FGFR2, GLUT1, CAXII, CD44v6 was positive in 77% of cases and might be considered for development of molecular tracers for male breast cancer.														1932-6203	1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0053353

Methods: Of 145 cases reviewed, 120 with samples available from both primary tumors and paired metastases were included in the study. For each receptor, the DR was calculated as the proportion of discordant cases with respect to the total number of patients. Results: A change in ER status was observed in 19 cases (DR 16.4%), while PgR status was modified in 48 cases (DR 41.7%). HER-2 was altered in 21 cases (DR 17.5%), and Ki67 in 33 patients (DR 38.8%). Patients with Ki67 <20% had a significantly higher postrecurrence survival (PRS) compared to patients with Ki67 >= 20% (p = 0.0006). Patients with ER-positive tumors showed a trend to-wards higher PRS (p = 0.064) compared to ER-negative patients. No differences in PRS were seen among patients with altered PgR or HER2 status. Conclusions: Changes in the cell biology of breast cancer metastasis would seem to occur and biopsy could potentially guide the choice of treatment and provide useful information on prognosis.

We analyzed 257 male patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer from numerous German population-based cancer registries treated with tamoxifen (N = 207) or aromatase inhibitors (N = 50). The median follow-up was 42.2 (range 2-115) months. Median age at diagnosis was 68 (range 36-91) years. Thirty-seven (17.9 %) patients treated with tamoxifen and 16 (32.0 %) patients treated with AI died (log rank p = 0.007). After the adjustment for the patient's age, tumor size, node status, and tumor grading, the AI treatment was linked to a 1.5-fold increase in risk of mortality compared to tamoxifen (HR 1.55; 95 % CI: 1.13-2.13; p = 0.007). The overall survival in male breast cancer was significantly better after adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen compared to an aromatase inhibitor. Tamoxifen should be considered as the treatment of choice for hormone-receptor-positive male breast cancer.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-012-2355-3

The median age of the patients was 64.5 years. Patient characteristics including clinicopathologic factors, treatment modalities, survival and prognostic factors were evaluated. Patients were subdivided into two groups according to their age (young, 65 years; old, epsilon 65 years) and compared based on these factors.Elderly male breast cancer patients had larger tumors in more advanced stages at the time of diagnosis compared with younger patients. In spite of the larger tumors at presentation, older patients had tumors with more favorable biological characteristics, such as higher ratio of estrogen and progesterone receptor expression. Ten-year cancer-specific survival for older patients was 49.2 compared with 55.8 in younger men (P 0.8). Prognostic factors influencing overall survival in univariate analysis were: the presence of metastatic axillary lymph nodes (P 0.0001), T stage (P 0.001) and age epsilon 65 years. Multivariate analysis indicated T stage (P 0.008) and N stage (P 0.038) as the significant negative prognostic factors for overall survival. Although surgery, radiotherapy and hormone therapy were equally utilized in old and young patients, old patients were less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy.Our study demonstrated the differences in the clinical and biological characteristics of male breast cancer according to the age of the patients.														0368-2811	1465-3621	10.1093/jjco/hys193																		
J	BCI:BCI201300180033	22918167			High proliferation is associated with inferior Outcome in male breast cancer patients		Nilsson, Cecilia (cecilia.nilsson@ltv.se) ; Koliadi, Anthoula; Johansson, Ida; Ahlin, Cecilia; Thorstenson, Sten; Bergkvist, Leif; Hedenfalk, Ingrid; Fjallskog, Marie-Louise									Modern Pathology		2013	JAN 2013	26	1	87-94	87	94							Assessment of proliferation is important in female breast cancer and individual treatment decisions are based upon its results, especially in the lumina! subgroups. Gene expression analyses fail to group male breast cancer into the intrinsic subgroups previously established in female breast cancer. Even though proliferation has been shown to divide male breast cancer into molecular subgroups with different prognoses, the clinical importance of proliferation markers has not yet been elucidated. Previous studies in male breast cancer have demonstrated contradictory results regarding the prognostic impact of histological grade and Ki-67, parameters strongly associated with proliferation. The aim of the present project was to study proliferation in male breast cancer by assessing other proliferation-related markers viz. cyclins A, B, D1 and mitotic count. A total of 197 male breast cancer cases with accessible paraffin-embedded material and outcome data were investigated. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed on tissue microarrays. Kaplan-Meier estimates and the Cox proportional regression models were used for survival analyses with breast cancer death as the event. The subset of patients with high expression of cyclin A (hazard ratio (HR) 3.7; P=0.001) and B (HR 2.7; P=0.02) demonstrated a poorer survival. Furthermore, high mitotic count was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer death (HR 2.5; P=0.01). In contrast, cyclin D1 overexpression was predictive of better breast cancer survival (HR 0.3; P=0.001). In conclusion, high levels of cyclin A and B expression and an elevated mitotic count result in a two to threefold higher risk for breast cancer death, whereas cyclin D1 overexpression halves the risk. The clinical utility of these proliferation markers needs further elucidation.

Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon disease and there is limited information on the prognostic impact of routinely used clinicopathological parameters. Material and methods. In a retrospective setting, we reviewed 197 MBC patients with accessible paraffin-embedded tumor tissue and clinicopathological data. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stainings were performed on tissue microarrays and histological grading on conventional slides. Cox proportional regression models were applied for uni- and multivariate analyses using breast cancer death as the event. Results. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor positivity were demonstrated in 93% and 77% of patients, respectively. Nottingham histologic grade (NHG) III was seen in 41% and HER2 positivity in 11%. Classification into molecular subtypes using IHC markers according to three alternative definitions revealed luminal A and luminal B in 81% vs. 11%; 48% vs. 44% and 41% vs. 42% of cases. Two cases of basal-like were identified, but no cases of HER2-like. Factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer death were node positivity (HR 4.5; 95% CI 1.8-11.1), tumor size >20 mm (HR 3.3; 95% CI 1.4-7.9) and ER negativity (HR 10.9; 95% CI 3.2-37.9). No difference in breast cancer death between the luminal subgroups was demonstrated, regardless of definition. Conclusion. MBC tumors were more often of high grade, whereas HER2 overexpression was as frequent as in FBC. Lymph nodes, tumor size and ER status were independent predictors of breast cancer death. The prognostic impact of molecular subtyping in MBC seems to differ from that previously established in FBC.

Because of its rarity evidence of the usefulness sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for male breast cancer has not been established. Moreover, a navigation system which can easily determine the incision site of SLNB is needed because a second incision for SLNB is necessary in most cases. We report successful computed tomographic lymphography (CTLG)-guided SLNB in two male breast cancer cases: the first patient was a 79-year-old man and the second was a 64-year-old man. Both had presented with a lump behind the nipple. Clinical diagnoses were early breast carcinoma in both cases. The second patient took tamoxifen 20 mg daily as neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. SLNs were clearly visualized by CTLG, allowing mastectomies with SLNB to be performed. Both SLNB were negative, such that axillary lymph node dissection was not needed. Preoperative CTLG is useful for visualizing lymph flow and detecting SLN in male breast cancer.														2193-1801	2193-1801	10.1186/2193-1801-2-351

Conflicting results, based on small series, have been reported for clinically relevant biomarkers. Methods and results: One hundred and thirty-four cases of male breast cancer were immunohistochemically stained on tissue microarrays for oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), BRST2, cyclin D1, bcl-2, p53, p16, p21, Ki67, cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, CK14, and epidermal growth factor receptor. Data were correlated with clinicopathological features and patient outcome. High mitotic count and high grade were correlated with high Ki67, HER2 amplification/overexpression, p53 accumulation, high p21 expression, low PR expression, and low bcl-2 expression. PR negativity (P = 0.009) and p53 accumulation (P = 0.042) were correlated with decreased 5-year survival and were independent markers for patient outcome in Cox regression. In unsupervised hierarchical clustering, four groups were identified that were correlated with distinctive clinicopathological features. The hormone negative/ER-positive/high-grade cluster was significantly associated with decreased survival (P = 0.011) and was an independent prognostic factor in Cox regression. Conclusions: Several tissue biomarkers are associated with an aggressive phenotype in male breast cancer. PR and p53 are the most promising individual prognostic markers. On the basis of immunophenotype, four distinctive and prognostically relevant male breast cancer groups were identified, indicating that protein expression profiling may be clinically useful in male breast cancer.														0309-0167	1365-2559	10.1111/j.1365-2559.2012.04330.x

(p.j.vandiest@umcutrecht.nl)									Modern Pathology		2012	DEC 2012	25	12	1559-1565	1559	1565							Numerous studies have shown the prognostic significance of nuclear morphometry in breast cancer patients. Wide acceptance of morphometric methods has, however, been hampered by the tedious and time consuming nature of the manual segmentation of nuclei and the lack of equipment for high throughput digitization of slides. Recently, whole slide imaging became more affordable and widely available, making fully digital pathology archives feasible. In this study, we employ an automatic nuclei segmentation algorithm to extract nuclear morphometry features related to size and we analyze their prognostic value in male breast cancer. The study population comprised 101 male breast cancer patients for whom survival data was available (median follow-up of 5.7 years). Automatic segmentation was performed on digitized tissue microarray slides, and for each patient, the mean nuclear area and the standard deviation of the nuclear area were calculated. In univariate survival analysis, a significant difference was found between patients with low and high mean nuclear area (P=0.022), while nuclear atypia score did not provide prognostic value. In Cox regression, mean nuclear area had independent additional prognostic value (P=0.032) to tumor size and tubule formation. In conclusion, we present an automatic method for nuclear morphometry and its application in male breast cancer prognosis. The automatically extracted mean nuclear area proved to be a significant prognostic indicator. With the increasing availability of slide scanning equipment in pathology labs, these kinds of quantitative approaches can be easily integrated in the workflow of routine pathology practice.

H.; de Bruin, Peter C.; Oudejans, Joost J.; Hinrichs, Bernd; van Diest, Paul J. (p.j.vandiest@umcutrecht.nl)									Modern Pathology		2012	OCT 2012	25	10	1397-1404	1397	1404							Fibrotic focus is a scar-like lesion near the center of a carcinoma and has been associated with high-grade, lymph node metastases and poor survival in female breast cancers. Hypoxia is suggested to be the crucial link between fibrotic focus and aggressive tumor phenotype and is also itself a poor prognostic marker. We here set out to study fibrotic focus and hypoxia in male breast cancer for the first time. In a group of 134 male breast cancer patients, the presence and size of a fibrotic focus and the expression of three hypoxia-related immunohistochemical stainings, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, carbonic anhydrase IX and Glut-1 were studied in correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosis. Fibrotic focus was seen in 25% of the male breast cancer cases and was correlated with hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha overexpression (P = 0.023), high grade (P = 0.005), high mitotic activity (P = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (P = 0.037). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha-positive tumors were more often high grade (P = 0.003) and HER2 amplified (P = 0.005). Glut-1 expression was also more common in grade 3 tumors (P = 0.038), but no association between carbonic anhydrase IX and any clinicopathological feature was found. Fibrotic focus >8mm and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha overexpression were correlated with decreased patients' outcome (P = 0.035 and 0.008, respectively). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha overexpression was an independent and the most powerful predictor of survival in multivariate analysis (P = 0.029; hazard ratio 2.5). In conclusion, the presence of a fibrotic focus is associated with hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha overexpression, and both are associated with aggressive tumor phenotype and poor survival in male breast cancer. These markers seem to have similar clinical importance as previously reported in female breast cancer.

J	BCI:BCI201200704697				Male breast cancer: A retrospective study comparing survival with female breast cancer		Li Baojiang (libaojiang8052@126.com) ; Liu Tingting; Li Gang; Zhang Li									Oncology Letters		2012	OCT 2012	4	4	642-646	642	646							Male breast cancer is a rare disease. The aim of this study was to compare overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in a group of matched males and females with breast cancer. The clinical data and survival status of 42 operable male breast cancer (MBC) cases treated at the Central Hospital of Tai'an from 1982 to 2006 were collected. Each MBC patient recorded in the database was matched with two female breast cancer (FBC) patients. Matching was conducted based on age, year of diagnosis, stage and pathology. SPSS 16.0 software was used for statistical analysis. The Chi-square test was used for the categorical data, the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to analyze survival and the log-rank test was used to compare curves between the groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. The 42 MBC patients were matched with 84 FBC patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 58.0 +/- 11.3 years for males and 57.1 +/- 10.6 years for females, and the median follow-up time was 64 months (range, 5-262 months) for males and 71 months (range, 29-283 months) for females. Significant differences were identified for tumor location, hormone receptor status, adjuvant chemotherapy and hormone therapy between the two groups. Monofactorial analysis demonstrated that tumor size, lymph node status and AJCC stage were prognostic factors in MBC patients. The 5- and 10-year DFS rates were 61.2 and 40.7% for males, and 68.7 and 43.0% for females, respectively. The Sand 10-year OS rates were 75.3 and 52.3% for males, and 82.9 and 63.2% for females, respectively. In our study, male breast carcinoma patients had a worse prognosis compared to female breast carcinoma patients which may be due to the deficiency of adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy.														1792-1074	1792-1082	10.3892/ol.2012.809

Strahlentherapie und Onkologie		2012	SEP 2012	188	9	782-787	782	787							Reasons for inferior outcome of male compared to female breast cancer are still under debate. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed male breast cancer cases to figure out possible treatment- and gender-related differences.A total of 40 men (median age 62 years) were curatively treated with mastectomy and postoperative radiotherapy from 1982-2007. They presented predominantly in stages II and IIIb. Postoperative radiotherapy was applied with doses of 1.8-2.5 Gy to a median of 50 Gy including regional lymphatics in 22 patients. Adjuvant systemic treatment consisted of chemotherapy (22.5%) and antihormonal treatment (55%). For reasons of comparison, we estimated outcome of a virtual female matched cohort for no/equal to men/optimal adjuvant treatment with the Adjuvant!OnlineA (R) 8.0 algorithm.After a median follow-up of 47 months, the estimated 5-year local control rate was 97%, disease-free and distant metastasis-free survival rates reached 79% and 82%, respectively. With update of survival data by tumor registry, mean overall survival reached 120 months with 5- and 10-year overall survival rates of 66% and 43%, respectively. Predominant prognostic factor was T-stage for overall survival (T1/2 vs. T4: > 80% vs. 30%). The generated virtual matched cohorts of women with equal characteristics reached superior 10-year-overall survival for no/equal to men/optimal adjuvant treatment with 55/59/68%.Compared to historical and virtual matched cohorts of women, male breast cancer patients had inferior outcome despite of equal stage and treatment which indicates that biological differences (of tumor or population) may contribute to worse prognosis.

J.; Hogenes, Marieke C. H.; de Bruin, Peter C.; Oudejans, Joost J.; Marchionni, Luigi; van Diest, Paul J. (p.j.vandiest@umcutrecht.nl)									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2012	AUG 2012	135	1	49-58	49	58							Gene amplification is an important mechanism for oncogene activation, a crucial step in carcinogenesis. Compared to female breast cancer, little is known on the genetic makeup of male breast cancer, because large series are lacking. Copy number changes of 21 breast cancer related genes were studied in 110 male breast cancers using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. A ratio of > 1.3 was regarded indicative for gene copy number gain and a ratio > 2.0 for gene amplification. Data were correlated with clinicopathological features, prognosis and 17 genes were compared with a group of female breast cancers. Gene copy number gain of CCND1, TRAF4, CDC6 and MTDH was seen in > 40 % of the male breast cancer cases, with also frequent amplification. The number of genes with copy number gain and several single genes were associated with high grade, but only CCND1 amplification was an independent predictor of adverse survival in Cox regression (p = 0.015; hazard ratio 3.0). In unsupervised hierarchical clustering a distinctive group of male breast cancer with poor prognosis (p = 0.009; hazard ratio 3.4) was identified, characterized by frequent CCND1, MTDH, CDC6, ADAM9, TRAF4 and MYC copy number gain. Compared to female breast cancers, EGFR (p = 0.005) and CCND1 (p = 0.041) copy number gain was more often seen in male breast cancer, while copy number gain of EMSY (p = 0.004) and CPD (p = 0.001) and amplification in general was less frequent. In conclusion, several female breast cancer genes also seem to be important in male breast carcinogenesis. However, there are also clear differences in copy number changes between male and female breast cancers, pointing toward differences in carcinogenesis between male and female breast cancer and emphasizing the importance of identifying biomarkers and therapeutic agents based on research in male breast cancer. In addition CCND1 amplification seems to be an independent prognosticator in male breast cancer.

Here we review results of the first regulated, nationwide program to provide HER2 ISH testing for all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, with a particular emphasis on cases where IHC and ISH results were discordant. Data from all laboratories participating in the program were collated. Cases with an equivocal ISH test result [by chromogenic ISH (CISH) or silver ISH (SISH)] were tested centrally by fluorescence ISH. Most laboratories also performed HER2 IHC, and 200 cases with discordant IHC and ISH results were selected for further analysis in a central laboratory. A total of 26 laboratories were involved and 53,402 tests were reported. Over a 4-year period the HER2 positivity rate decreased for primary cancers from 23.8 to 14.6 %, but remained relatively constant for samples from metastases. Average ISH reporting times were < 5 days for all yearly reporting periods. Test-repeat rates decreased for CISH (8.9-3.6 %) and SISH (13.7-8.4 %). Only 12 of 196 cases remained discordant after retesting in a central laboratory. These findings demonstrate the successful implementation of a regulated, national program that continues to collect data on HER2 status. The results also highlight the differences in IHC interpretation between local laboratories and a central, more experienced, laboratory. This model could be used to establish future biomarker-testing programs in other countries.

However, as MBC is a rare disease there are difficulties to undertake studies to identify specific MBC subgroups. At present, it is still largely unknown whether BRCA-related breast cancer (BC) in men may display specific characteristics as it is for BRCA-related BC in women. To investigate the clinical-pathologic features of MBC in association with BRCA mutations we established a collaborative Italian Multicenter Study on MBC with the aim to recruit a large series of MBCs. A total of 382 MBCs, including 50 BRCA carriers, were collected from ten Italian Investigation Centres covering the whole country. In MBC patients, BRCA2 mutations were associated with family history of breast/ovarian cancer (p < 0.0001), personal history of other cancers (p = 0.044) and contralateral BC (p = 0.001). BRCA2-associated MBCs presented with high tumor grade (p = 0.001), PR- (p = 0.026) and HER2+ (p = 0.001) status. In a multivariate logistic model BRCA2 mutations showed positive association with personal history of other cancers (OR 11.42, 95 % CI 1.79-73.08) and high tumor grade (OR 4.93, 95 % CI 1.02-23.88) and inverse association with PR+ status (OR 0.19, 95 % CI 0.04-0.92). Based on immunohistochemical (IHC) profile, four molecular subtypes of MBC were identified. Luminal A was the most common subtype (67.7 %), luminal B was observed in 26.5 % of the cases and HER2 positive and triple negative were represented by 2.1 % and 3.7 % of tumors, respectively. Intriguingly, we found that both luminal B and HER2 positive subtypes were associated with high tumor grade (p = 0.003 and 0.006, respectively) and with BRCA2 mutations (p = 0.016 and 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicate that BRCA2-related MBCs represent a subgroup of tumors with a peculiar phenotype characterized by aggressive behavior. The identification of a BRCA2-associated phenotype might define a subset of MBC patients eligible for personalized clinical management.

Poor level of awareness often results in late presentation and delayed diagnosis in our environment. This study was done to analyse the demographic data, management and survival of male breast cancers in Indian subset of patients and compare it with that of western literature. Materials and Methods: A 10 year (2001-2010) retrospective study of all male breast cancers was done. Data regarding the incidence, presentation, histopathology, stage and grade of tumor, management and outcome of patients were analysed. Results: 26 cases of male breast cancer were encountered. This comprised 0.4% of all breast cancers seen in our department during the 10 year period. The ages of patients ranged from 45-75 years with a mean age of 57 years. Family history was present in 4 patients. Clinically, symptoms included self-detected lump in 23 (88.5%) patients, nipple retraction in 12 (46.1%) and pain in 12 (46.1%). All cases were unilateral (16 on right, 10 on left). Disease most commonly involved central quadrant (9 patients). Grade 3 disease was found in 13 patients and Stage 3 disease was most commonly encountered (13 patients). None of our patients received neo adjuvant chemotherapy. 20 (76.9%) patients had modified radical mastectomy and 6 (23.1%) had radical mastectomy. Most of our patients were hormone receptor positive (21 patients). Bilateral orchidectomy, Adjuvant chemotherapy, Adjuvant radiotherapy and Tamoxifen were offered in 3 (11.5%), 16 (61.5%), 17 (65.4%) and 15 (57.7%) patients respectively. Follow up ranged from 1-59 months. Conclusion: Male breast cancer is rare in our centre. Late presentation with advanced disease is a common feature in our environment. Further multiinstitutional, prospective studies are needed for better understanding of management of male breast cancers in Indian subset of patients.														0019-509X	1998-4774	10.4103/0019-509X.104484

Hence, this study aims to review the data from our local experience in order to better delineate the disease characteristics in our population. Materials and Methods: Male patients with histologically proven breast cancer were identified from a prospectively collected database. The clinical, histopathological and survival data were reviewed retrospectively and analysed. Results: Twenty-one patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 68 years. Eighteen patients underwent simple mastectomy with curative intent, with the remainding patients having metastatic disease at presentation. Almost half of the patients presented with stage III or IV disease. At the time of analysis, median overall survival was 50 months and median disease-free survival was 47.5 months. None of the patients had any documented family history or risk factors for male breast cancer. Conclusion: The disease appears to be a sporadic and rare occurrence in the local male population. A high index of suspicion should be maintained in males presented with a unilateral breast lump so that appropriate treatment can be instituted.														0304-4602

Using a co-ordinated multi-centre approach, we present the first large scale biomarker study to define and compare hormone receptor profiles and survival between male and female invasive breast cancer. We defined and compared hormone receptor profiles and survival between 251 male and 263 female breast cancers matched for grade, age, and lymph node status. Tissue microarrays were immunostained for ER alpha, ER beta 1, -2, -5, PR, PRA, PRB and AR, augmented by HER2, CK5/6, 14, 18 and 19 to assist typing. Hierarchical clustering determined differential nature of influences between genders. Luminal A was the most common phenotype in both sexes. Luminal B and HER2 were not seen in males. Basal phenotype was infrequent in both. No differences in overall survival at 5 or 10 years were observed between genders. Notably, AR-positive luminal A male breast cancer had improved overall survival over female breast cancer at 5 (P = 0.01, HR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.26-0.87) but not 10 years (P = 0.29, HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.46-1.26) and both 5 (P = 0.04, HR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.07-0.97) and 10 years (P = 0.04, HR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.12-0.97) in the unselected group. Hierarchical clustering revealed common clusters between genders including total PR-PRA-PRB and ER beta 1/2 clusters. A striking feature was the occurrence of ER alpha on distinct clusters between genders. In female breast cancer, ER alpha clustered with PR and its isoforms; in male breast cancer, ER alpha clustered with ER beta isoforms and AR. Our data supports the hypothesis that breast cancer is biologically different in males and females suggesting implications for clinical management. With the incidence of male breast cancer increasing this provides impetus for further study.

A paper was included if both male and female breast cancer were available. If two publications covered the same geographic area, only the publication with a longer study period was included. Random effects models and mixed effect meta-regressions were used to analyze data of 1201 male and 36,172 female breast cancer patients from 27 African countries. We showed that the male-to-female breast cancer ratio was 0.042 overall and it has decreased in recent years. Additionally, male breast cancer patients in Africa had the disease at age 54.6 on average, 7 years older than female patients. In conclusion, male breast cancers in Africa are characterized as late onset and male-to-female breast cancer ratio in Africa is higher than populations in developed countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We retrospectively reviewed cases of male breast cancer treated with radiotherapy at Stanford University Medical Center with an emphasis on 22 patients treated with surgery and locoregional radiotherapy. We report trends in the surgical techniques as well as in the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. There were no isolated locoregional failures in this cohort, and 5-year disease-free survival was 65%. The use of contemporary surgical and radiotherapeutic techniques in men is discussed. We conclude that treatment guidelines designed for women should be applied to the locoregional management of breast cancer in men. However, large international prospective registries and inclusion of men in cooperative group randomized trials will be important to confirm the safety and efficacy of modern treatment modalities for male breast cancer.

J	BCI:BCI201200529562	22661137			Increasing prevalence of breast cancer among Saudi patients attending a tertiary referral hospital: a retrospective epidemiologic study		Al-Rikabi, Ammar; Husain, Sufia									Croatian Medical Journal		2012	JUN 2012	53	3	239-243	239	243							Aim To determine the pattern of breast diseases among Saudi patients who underwent breast biopsy, with special emphasis on breast carcinoma.Methods A retrospective review was made of all breast biopsy reports of a mass or lump from male and female patients seen between January 2001 and December 2010 at the King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Results Of 1035 breast tissues reviewed, 939 specimens (90.7%) were from female patients. There were 690 benign (65.8%) and 345 (34.2%) malignant cases. In women, 603 (64.2%) specimens were benign and 336 (35.8%) were malignant. In men, 87 specimens (90.6%) were benign and 9 (9.4%) were malignant. All malignant cases from male patients belonged to invasive ductal carcinoma and the majority of malignant cases from female patients belonged to invasive/infiltrating ductal carcinoma. The proportion of malignancy was 18% in patients younger than 40 years and 63.2% in patients older than 60 years. The mean age of onset for malignancy was 48.6 years. The annual percentage incidence of malignant breast cancer steadily increased by 4.8%, from an annual rate of 23.5% in 2000 to 47.2% in 2007.Conclusion Among Saudi patients, there is a significant increase in the incidence of breast cancer, which occurs at an earlier age than in western countries. Continued vigilance, mammographic screening, and patient education are needed to establish early diagnosis and perform optimal treatment.														0353-9504	1332-8166	10.3325/cmj.2012.53.239

Data of 20,673 patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer (male: n = 84) who completed a questionnaire after discharge from hospital were analysed. HRQoL (SF-36), age, sex, education, native language, insurance status, and partnership status were measured. Cancer staging, treatment (partial mastectomy vs. radical mastectomy), and cancer site were indicated by the clinicians. The HRQoL scores of male breast cancer patients were compared with reference populations. Differences in HRQoL scores between men and women were compared using t tests and regression analysis. Compared to female breast cancer patients, male patients scored significantly higher on seven of eight subscales (physical functioning, role functioning-physical and emotional, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, and mental health) in the regression analysis. Compared to the reference populations (general male population, men aged 61-70, and the cancer-affected population), male breast cancer patients scored lower on SF-36 subscales on average, with major differences in emotional and physical role functioning. The results suggest that male breast cancer patients may need early interventions that specifically target role functioning, which is severely impaired compared to the male reference population. Future research needs to assess HRQoL with cancer-specific questionnaires and longitudinal designs also focussing on male patients in breast centres.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-012-1970-3

(p.j.vandiest@umcutrecht.nl)									American Journal of Surgical Pathology		2012	MAY 2012	36	5	762-768	762	768							Gynecomastia is the most common abnormality in the male breast and has been associated with male breast cancer, but whether there is an etiological role remains unknown. In the present study we conducted an immunohistochemical investigation to further characterize gynecomastia. A total of 46 cases of gynecomastia were immunohistochemically stained on tissue microarrays for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, HER2, androgen receptor, cytokeratins (CK5, CK14, CK7, and CK8/18), p63, E-cadherin, BRST2, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, p53, p16, p21, and Ki67. In addition, 8 cases of male ductal carcinoma in situ and normal breast tissue obtained from autopsies (n = 10) and adjacent to male breast cancer (n = 5) were studied. Normal ductal male breast epithelial cells were very often ER and Bcl-2 positive (> 69%), and progesterone receptor and androgen receptor expression was also common (> 39%). Gynecomastia showed a consistent 3-layered pattern: 1 myoepithelial and 2 epithelial cell layers with a distinctive immunohistochemical staining pattern. The intermediate luminal layer, consisting of vertically oriented cuboidal-to-columnar cells, is hormone receptor positive and expresses Bcl-2 and cyclin D1. The inner luminal layer is composed of smaller cells expressing CK5 and often CK14 but is usually negative for hormone receptors and Bcl-2. Male ductal carcinoma in situ was consistently ER positive and CK5/CK14 negative. In conclusion, for the first time we describe the 3-layered ductal epithelium in gynecomastia, which has a distinctive immunohistochemical profile. These results indicate that different cellular compartments exist in gynecomastia, and therefore gynecomastia does not seem to be an obligate precursor lesion of male breast cancer.														0147-5185	1532-0979	10.1097/PAS.0b013e31824324e6

Less data are available on the risks between defined multiple affected close and distant relatives for which the reliability of data may be an issue. Data on affected males are sparse. These questions and the probable genetic models were addressed in this study by means of a nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database. We estimated the effect of family history of breast cancer by Poisson regression for women of at least 30 years of age after adjusting for age, period, region, socioeconomic status, number of children, and age at first birth. The results of the study showed that relative risk (RR) for breast cancer was associated with a first degree as well as second-degree family history. Having at least two female affected first-degree relatives increased the RR at least to 2.8, favoring an additive interaction. The risk was increased around ten times in women with both parents affected. When either a father or a mother was affected, the RRs were nearly identical (RR = 1.73 and 1.74, respectively). The RR for a woman increased more when a brother was affected (RR = 2.48) compared to when a sister was affected (RR = 1.87). Having an affected grandmother showed lower familial excess risks than having an affected half sister (RR = 1.27, and 1.26; and RR = 1.39, and 1.50; respectively, for maternal and paternal relatives). We concluded that when both parents were diagnosed with breast cancer, the risk for the daughter was increased tenfold. Having an affected brother showed a somewhat higher risk than having an affected sister. The data suggest that male breast cancer has a higher genetic basis than female breast cancer, which invites further search of the underlying mechanisms.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-011-1915-2

Interest continues to increase in HR pathway function due to the development of new therapeutic agents which selectively exploit DNA damage repair pathways. Currently the most promising of these new agents are inhibitors of poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP). The response of cancers known to be deficient in HR, due to BRCA1 or 2 mutations has been demonstrated, and a wider use of PARP inhibitors in cancers with mutations of other HR pathway genes has been suggested. With ongoing clinical studies into the use of PARP inhibitors, further understanding of the HR pathway, to allow patient selection by cancer biology, is now essential. Numerous studies have investigated individual aberrations of genes involved in the HR pathway. Here we collate this evidence to give an overview of the role of the HR pathway in human cancer.

We reviewed 45 male breast cancer patients treated in our institution from 2003 to 2008. Only five male breast cancer patients were HER2-positive. In reviewing the published data, we found no cases of thyroid cancer and concurrent breast cancer in men. However, breast cancer and thyroid cancer have shown close association in women. This finding therefore provokes speculation as to whether we should investigate whether women with HER2-positive breast cancer are at a higher risk for thyroid cancer. Although this observation seems to be clinically prevalent, publications are sparse in clinical research areas linking thyroid cancer to breast cancer.														0091-7370	1550-8080

(p.j.vandiest@umcutrecht.nl)									Modern Pathology		2012	MAR 2012	25	3	398-404	398	404							Molecular subtyping of breast cancer by gene expression has proven its significance in females. Immunohistochemical surrogates have been used for this classification, because gene expression profiling is not yet routinely feasible. Male breast cancer is rare and large series are lacking. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry for molecular subtyping of male breast cancer. A total of 134 cases of male breast cancer were immunohistochemically stained on tissue microarrays for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as well as for CK5/6, CK14, and Ki67. HER2 was also assessed by chromogen in situ hybridization. Cases were classified as luminal A (ER+ and/or PR+, and HER2- and Ki67 low), luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, and HER2+ or Ki67 high), HER2 driven (ER+, PR+, HER2+), basal-like (ER-, PR-, HER2-, CK5/6+ and/or CK14+ and/or EGFR+), or unclassifiable triple-negative ( negative for all six markers). Luminal type A was by far the most encountered type of male breast cancers, representing 75% of the cases. Luminal type B was seen in 21% and the remaining 4% of cases were classified as basal-like (n=4) and unclassifiable triple-negative (n=1). No HER2 driven cases were identified. Patients with basal-like cancer were significantly younger (P=0.034). Luminal B type cancers showed significantly higher histological grade (P<0.001), mitotic index (P<0.001), and PR negativity (P=0.005) compared with luminal type A cancers. In conclusion, most male breast cancers are luminal A and luminal B types, whereas basal-like, unclassifiable triple-negative, and HER2 driven male breast cancers are rare. Luminal type B seem to represent a subtype with an aggressive phenotype. This distribution of molecular subtypes in male breast cancer is clearly different compared with female breast cancers, pointing to possible important differences in carcinogenesis.

(engyms2007@yahoo.com)									Cancer Biology Medicine		2012	MAR 2012	9	1	23-28	23	28							Objective Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease representing less than 1% of all malignancies. The objective of the study is to report clinicopathological characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes of MBC in Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt.Methods This retrospective study focused on male breast cancer patients during 10 years (2000-2009). The studied variables were data regarding general characteristics of patients, treatment modalities and survival.Results The series included 37 patients (0.8% of all breast cancer). The median age was 57.7 years (range: 26-86 years). The main clinical complaint was a mass beneath the areola in 94.5% of the cases. Most patients had a locally advanced disease. 94.5% of tumors were invasive duct carcinomas. The treatment was essentially surgery in 91.8%, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (in 89.2%), hormonal therapy (in 56.7%) and chemotherapy (in 91.8%). Follow-up period ranged from 6-115 months. Local recurrence occurred in 4 cases and metastasis in 11 cases. The 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 81.6% and 60.5%, respectively. The 2-year and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 68.4%, and 52.6%, respectively. OS was not significantly affected by any of the studied parameters. Factors influencing DFS were: T stage (P=0.05), positive lymph nodes (P=0.043), metastasis (P=0.004), and chemotherapy (P=0.046).Conclusions MBC is a rare disease and often diagnosed at a locally advanced stage. The management of male and female breast carcinoma is identical. Future research for better understanding of this disease is needed to improve the management and prognosis of male breast cancer patients.														2095-3941		10.3969/j.issn.2095-3941.2012.01.004

We evaluated the complete coding and splice site regions of BRCA1/2 in 193 sporadic patients. In addition, a de novo mutation was further investigated with ultra deep sequencing and microsatellite marker analysis. In 17 patients (8.8%), a deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutation was identified. The highest mutation detection ratio (3/7 = 42.9%) was obtained in sporadic patients diagnosed with breast and ovarian cancer after the age of 40. In 21 bilateral breast cancer patients, two mutations were identified (9.5%). Furthermore, 140 sporadic patients with unilateral breast cancer were investigated. Mutations were only identified in patients diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 40 (12/128 = 9.4% vs. 0/12 with Dx > 40). No mutations were detected in 17 sporadic male breast cancer and 6 ovarian cancer patients. BRCA1 c.3494_3495delTT was identified in a patient diagnosed with breast and ovarian cancer at the age of 52 and 53, respectively, and was proven to have occurred de novo at the paternal allele. Our study shows that the mutation detection probability in specific patient subsets can be significant, therefore mutation analysis should be considered in sporadic patients. As a consequence, a family history for the disease and an early age of onset should not be used as the only criteria for mutation analysis of BRCA1/2. The relatively high mutation detection ratio suggests that the prevalence of BRCA1/2 may be underestimated, especially in sporadic patients who developed breast and ovarian cancer. In addition, although rare, the possibility of a de novo occurrence in a sporadic patient should be considered.

Some of the families reported with germline PALB2 mutations presented male breast cancer as a characteristic clinical feature. Therefore, we wanted to investigate the contribution of germline PALB2 mutations in a set of 131 Spanish BRCA1/BRCA2-negative breast/ovarian cancer families with at least one male breast cancer case. The analysis included direct sequencing of all coding exons and intron/exon boundaries as well as a Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification-based analysis of genomic rearrangements. For the first time we have identified a genomic rearrangement of PALB2 gene involving a large deletion from exon 7 to 11 in a breast cancer family. We have also identified several PALB2 variants, but no other obvious deleterious PALB2 mutation has been found. Thus, our study does not support an enrichment of PALB2 germline mutations in the subset of breast cancer families with male breast cancer cases. The identification of intronic and exonic variants indicates the necessity of assessing the implications of variants that do not lead to PALB2 truncation in the pathoghenicity of the PALB2 gene.

Fortunately, this has changed over the years leading to an increased awareness about male breast cancer. Although male breast cancer constitutes only about 1% of all diagnosed breast cancer cases, an increased mortality is seen in this patient population. This is probably caused by late diagnosis as a consequence of low level of concern about breast cancer among male patients.However, the vast majority of lesions of the male breast are benign, gynecomastia being the number one cause of unilateral or bilateral breast mass. Since it is important to avoid unnecessary surgical treatment without missing malignancy, accurate diagnostic tools are necessary in order to triage these patients. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy has demonstrated excellent accuracy in the diagnosis and management of breast lesions in female patients. In addition, several authors have proven the value of this technique in the evaluation of lesions of the male breast. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy permits accurate diagnosis in many lesions arising in the male breast. It also allows gathering cytological material that can be used for ancillary studies which enhances the diagnostic value of this technique. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2012; 40: 179-184.

The seventh American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system was used. Patients treated with and without postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) were analyzed. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as time duration from diagnosis to first recurrence. Overall survival (OS) was defined as time duration from pathologic diagnosis to death or last follow-up with any death defined as an event. Survival estimates were obtained using Kaplan-Meier methodology.Results: From January 1977 to December 2006, 81 men had invasive ductal carcinoma. The median age was 65 (range, 35-87 years). There were 15 Stage I, 40 Stage II, 20 Stage III, and 6 Stage IV patients. Median follow-up time was 46 months (range, 1-225 months). Of the 75 patients treated with curative intent, 29 did not receive PMRT and 46 completed PMRT. Patients who received PMRT demonstrated no benefit in overall survival (p = 0.872) but significantly better local recurrence free survival (p < 0.001) compared with those who did not receive RT. There was trend toward improving locoregional recurrence with PMRT in patients with high-risk features (node-positive, advanced stage, and <= 2 mm or unknown surgical margin). The median, 5-year, and 10-year disease-free survival and overall survival for the 75 patients were 77.7 months, 66.3%, 32.7%, and 91.2 months, 73.9%, and 36.6%, respectively.Conclusion: The experience at LRCP suggests that high-risk MBC patients should consider PMRT to improve their chance of local recurrence-free survival.

Methods: A total of 43 cases of MBC were examined retrospectively using a semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Ki-67, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2), epidermal growth factor receptor and cytokeratin 5/6. Patients were classified into the following categories: luminal A, luminal B, Her2-positive or basal-like subtypes. Results: The median age of patients was 63 years (r: 32-89). The predominant histology was invasive ductal carcinoma (91%). Only 1 patient had advanced breast cancer at diagnosis. Ninety-three percent were ER-positive and 84% were PR-positive. Two patients had tumors that were ER-and PR-negative. The distribution of tumor molecular subtypes was 19 (44%) luminal A, 22 (51%) luminal B and 2 (5%) basal-like. The Her2-positive tumor subtype was not identified. The clinicopathological characteristics did not differ significantly between tumor subtypes A and B. There were no significant differences in 6-year disease-free survival (74 vs. 82%, p = 0.77) or overall survival (74 vs. 82%, p = 0.69) between luminal A and luminal B subtypes, respectively. Conclusion: The most common subtypes in our cohort of MBC were luminal B followed by luminal A, and no differences were found between both tumor subtypes in terms of clinicopathologic characteristics and patient outcome.

(reinera@mskcc.org) ; Jacks, Lindsay M.; Van Zee, Kimberly J.; Panageas, Katherine S.									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2011	NOV 2011	130	1	301-306	301	306							Each year there are an estimated 200,000 new breast cancer cases diagnosed in the United States; of these, 1% of cases are in men. Lymphedema can be a devastating complication from breast cancer and its treatment. Currently, almost all lymphedema-related research is based on women and extrapolated to men. We conducted the first population-based study of men with incident breast cancer of any stage, diagnosed from 1998 to 2005, who were 65 years and older in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. We utilized claims related to lymphedema and lymphedema treatment in our cohort. We defined 'lymphedema-specific' claims to contain the word 'lymphedema' in the Medicare claim description; similarly, 'lymphedema-related' claims were defined as treatments reimbursed for lymphedema but not necessarily containing the word 'lymphedema' in the Medicare claim description. We identified 628 men with incident breast cancer from 1998 to 2005 who were 65 years and older. The cumulative incidence, censored for deaths, of lymphedema-specific claims at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years was 8.0, 9.2, 10.5, and 10.5%, respectively. The median follow-up was 3.4 years and for those without any event was 4.7 years. The cumulative incidence, censored for deaths, of lymphedema-related claims at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years was 26.9, 32.2, 35.4, and 39.8%. Rates for men were similar to analogous rates for women. Lymphedema is a common complication affecting men with breast cancer as well as women and appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies need to be implemented for both genders.

Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) provides a method to quantitatively measure the changes of DNA copy number and to map them directly onto the complete linear genome sequences. The aim of this study was to investigate DNA imbalances by aCGH and compare them with a female breast cancer dataset.We used Agilent Human Genome CGH Microarray Kit 44B and 44 K to compare genomic alterations in 25 male breast cancer tissues studied at NCC of Bari and 16 female breast cancer deposited with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE 12659). Data analysis was performed with Nexus Copy Number 5.0 software.All the 25 male and 16 female breast cancer samples displayed some chromosomal instability (110,93 alterations per patient in female, 69 in male). However, male samples presented a lower frequency of genetic alterations both in terms of loss and gains.aCGH is an effective tool for analysis of cytogenetic aberrations in MBC, which involves different biological processes than female. Male most significant altered regions contained genes involved in cell communication, cell division and immunological response, while female cell-cell junction maintenance, regulation of transcription and neuron development.

Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon disease. In the absence of randomized studies, current guidelines are mainly based on data on the management of female breast cancer (FBC). In light of concerns regarding the quality and extent of management in men, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether there are differences in tumor characteristics, treatment and outcome in male compared with FBC patients. Methods. Cohorts of male and female breast cancer were retrospectively analyzed. All male patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1993 and 2007 were identified from the Regional Breast Cancer Register of the Uppsala-rebro Region in Sweden. To increase the power of the study and obtain comparable cohorts we sampled four FBC patients (n = 396) for each MBC patient (n = 99) with similar age at diagnosis and time of diagnosis. Results. No differences were seen in stage at diagnosis between MBC and FBC. Men underwent mastectomy more often than women (92% vs. 44%, p < 0.001). Radiotherapy was delivered less often to MBC than FBC (44% vs. 56%, p = 0.034), but radiotherapy given after mastectomy (44% vs. 39%, p = 0.47) did not differ between the groups. No differences were found regarding adjuvant chemotherapy (16% vs. 21%; p = 0.31) or adjuvant endocrine therapy (59% vs. 52%, p = 0.24). Both overall survival (41% vs. 55%, p = 0.001) and relative survival (74% vs. 88%, p = 0.015) were inferior in MBC compared to FBC. Conclusion. Concerns regarding less extensive treatment in MBC patients were not supported by this study. Although no differences in the stage of the disease or treatment intensity could be demonstrated, outcome was inferior in the male group.

Using high-resolution genomic data, we aimed to characterize MBC by genomic imbalances and to compare it with female breast cancer (FBC), and further to investigate whether the genomic profiles hold any prognostic information. Fifty-six fresh frozen MBC tumors were analyzed using high-resolution tiling BAC arrays. Significant regions in common between cases were assessed using Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) analysis. A publicly available genomic data set of 359 FBC tumors was used for reference purposes. The data revealed a broad pattern of aberrations, confirming that MBC is a heterogeneous tumor type. Genomic gains were more common in MBC than in FBC and often involved whole chromosome arms, while losses of genomic material were less frequent. The most common aberrations were similar between the genders, but high-level amplifications were more common in FBC. We identified two genomic subgroups among MBCs; male-complex and male-simple. The male-complex subgroup displayed striking similarities with the previously reported luminal-complex FBC subgroup, while the male-simple subgroup seems to represent a new subgroup of breast cancer occurring only in men. There are many similarities between FBC and MBC with respect to genomic imbalances, but there are also distinct differences as revealed by high-resolution genomic profiling. MBC can be divided into two comprehensive genomic subgroups, which may be of prognostic value. The male-simple subgroup appears notably different from any genomic subgroup so far defined in FBC.

Clinical and nonhuman primate studies support the notion that androgens inhibit mammary proliferation and, thus, may protect from breast cancer. On the other hand, administration of conventional estrogen treatment suppresses endogenous androgens and may, thus, enhance estrogenic breast stimulation and possibly breast cancer risk. Addition of testosterone to the usual hormone therapy regimen may diminish the estrogen/progestin increase in breast cancer risk, but the impact of this combined use on mammary gland homeostasis still needs evaluation.														0889-8529	1558-4410	10.1016/j.ecl.2011.05.007

(asoliman@umich.edu) ; Iniesta, Maria; Eissa, Mohab; Hablas, Ahmed; Seifeldin, Ibrahim A.; Strahley, Ashley; Banerjee, Mousumi; Merajver, Sofia D.									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2011	SEP 2011	129	2	575-581	575	581							Male Breast Cancer (MBC) is a rare disease in the U.S., accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancers. Rates of MBC in Africa are more variable than in the U.S., therefore, understanding the risk factors involved in a population like Egypt can clarify the nature of MBC. The polyglutamine tract (QT) is a variable region of the androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear receptor which is important in modulating androgen actions and generally inhibits growth in breast tissue. It is hypothesized that a long QT results in weaker AR activity over the lifetime, resulting in less AR mediated control over cellular division and higher risk of MBC. As a corollary, we expect to see a distribution skewed toward longer QTs in MBC patients compared to controls and overall relatively longer QT's in populations with higher rates of MBC. This study aimed to investigate for the first time the distribution of AR QT lengths among MBC patients in Egypt. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 44 Egyptian MBC patients were analyzed for this polymorphism. Amplification followed by fragment length analysis revealed QT length. For the control series, blood from 43 Egyptian males without a family or personal history of breast or prostate cancers was collected and analyzed similarly. There was no significant difference between patients and controls with respect to mean QT length (P = 0.84; means were 19.5 +/- A 2.8 and 19.3 +/- A 4.2, for patients and controls, respectively). Though, short QT lengths were more prevalent among controls (14.0%), but almost absent in cases (2.3%). Although the mean lengths were not different in cases and controls, the near absence of short tracts in cases suggests a possible protective effect of very short QT lengths against MBC. In populations in which there is variable incidence of MBC by region, investigations of the distribution of AR QT lengths are warranted to further delineate its role as a risk factor in MBC.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-011-1510-6

Cancer Genetics		2011	AUG 2011	204	8	416-422	416	422							Deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 include those identified by sequencing technology as well as large genomic rearrangements (LGR). The main testing laboratory in the United States, Myriad Genetics Laboratory (MGL), has defined criteria for inclusion of LGR testing (i.e., BRACAnalysis Rearrangement Test, or BART (TM)) when BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing is ordered. We were interested in determining how many of our patients with LGR mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 fulfilled these MGL criteria. A retrospective chart review was performed on all individuals who underwent genetic testing at our institution since August 2006. Individuals who underwent LGR testing were classified as either having or not having a LGR in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Each individual's history was classified as meeting MGL defined LGR criteria, meeting criteria using third-degree relatives, or not meeting criteria. A total of 257 BART tests were ordered at our institution from August 2006 to August 2009. Five individuals (1.9%) had an LGR mutation. Two LGR were identified in patients who met MGL defined LGR criteria. One LGR was identified in a patient that met MGL defined LGR criteria only when using third-degree relatives. Two LGR were identified in individuals who did not meet MGL defined criteria. LGR are present in individuals who do not have a high pretest probability of carrying a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. These data suggest that when BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing is performed, testing should always include LGR testing so that the results are the most comprehensive and reliable.														2210-7762	2210-7770	10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.07.005

Clinical management is based on results obtained from randomized trials conducted in women notwithstanding data in the literature suggesting relevant gender-associated differences in terms of biological and clinical behavior. However, a genome-wide characterization of MBC on a transcriptional level is lacking. In this study, gene expression profiles of 37 estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MBC specimens were compared to that of 53 ER+ Female Breast Cancer (FBC) samples similar for clinical and patho-biological features. Almost 1000 genes were found differentially expressed (FDR < 1%) between female and male patients and biological interpretation highlighted a gender-associated modulation of key biological processes ranging from energy metabolism to regulation of translation and matrix remodeling as well as immune system recruitment. Moreover, an analysis of genes correlated to steroid receptors and ERBB2 suggested a prominent role for the androgen receptor in MBC with a minor relevance for progesterone receptor and ERBB2, although, similarly to FBC, a genomic amplification could be observed. Our findings support the idea that breast cancer is a quite different disease in male and female patients and the underlying gender-related biological differences are likely to have clinical implications connected with different susceptibility to treatment.

Mono-allelic and bi-allelic BRCA2 and PALB2 mutation carriers share many clinical characteristics. Mono-allelic germline mutations of BRCA2 and PALB2 are risk alleles of female breast cancer and have also been reported in familial pancreatic cancer, and bi-allelic mutations cause a severe form of Fanconi anemia. In view of these similarities, we investigated whether the prevalence of PALB2 mutations was increased in breast cancer families with the occurrence of BRCA2 associated tumours other than female breast cancer. PALB2 mutation analysis was performed in 110 non-BRCA1/2 cancer patients: (a) 53 ovarian cancer patients from female breast-and/or ovarian cancer families; (b) 45 breast cancer patients with a first or second degree relative with pancreatic cancer; and (c) 12 male breast cancer patients from female breast cancer families. One truncating PALB2 mutation, c.509_510delGA, resulting in p.Arg170X, was found in a male breast cancer patient. We conclude that germline mutations of PALB2 do not significantly contribute to cancer risk in non-BRCA1/2 cancer families with at least one patient with ovarian cancer, male breast cancer, and/or pancreatic cancer.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-010-1001-1

(brinton@nih.gov)									Acta Paediatrica		2011	JUN 2011	100	6	814-818	814	818							Aim:To evaluate male breast cancer (MBC) risk among patients with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) and relate this to possible biological explanations.Methods:A literature review was conducted to identify case series and epidemiologic studies that have evaluated MBC risk among patients with KS.Results:Case reports without expected values have often led to false impressions of risk. Problems include that a diagnosis of cancer can prompt a karyotypic evaluation and that many cases of KS are unrecognized, resulting in incomplete denominators. Few carefully conducted epidemiologic studies have been undertaken given that both KS and MBC are rare events. The largest study found 19.2- and 57.8-fold increases in incidence and mortality, respectively, with particularly high risks among 47,XXY mosaics. These risks were still approximately 70% lower than among females, contradicting case reports that patients with KS have breast cancer rates similar to females. Altered hormone levels (especially the ratio of oestrogens to androgens), administration of exogenous androgens, gynaecomastia and genetic factors have been offered as possible explanations for the high risks.Conclusions:Additional well-designed epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify which patients with KS are at a high risk of developing MBC and to distinguish between possible predisposing factors, including altered endogenous hormones.

J	BCI:BCI201100296170	20927582			Mutations in BRCA2 and PALB2 in male breast cancer cases from the United States		Ding, Yuan Chun; Steele, Linda; Kuan, Chih-Jen; Greilac, Scott; Neuhausen, Susan L. (sneuhausen@coh.org)									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2011	APR 2011	126	3	771-778	771	778							Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon disease with a frequency of approximately one in 1000. Due to the rarity of MBC, it is understudied and its etiology is poorly understood. Our objectives are to determine the frequency of pathogenic mutations in BRCA2 and PALB2 in MBC cases and to investigate the correlations between mutation status and cancer phenotypes. Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, direct sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were employed to screen for mutations in the BRCA2 gene, followed by direct sequencing of the PALB2 gene in BRCA2-negative MBC cases. Pathogenic BRCA2 mutations were identified in 18 of the 115 MBC cases, including four of the ten cases (40%) from breast cancer families and 14 of the 105 cases (13%) unselected for family history of breast cancer. The difference in BRCA2-mutation frequencies between cases with and without family history of breast cancer was not statistically significant (P = 0.145), suggesting that family history is not a strong predictor of carrying a mutation in males. We observed a highly significant association of carrying a pathogenic BRCA2 mutation with high tumor grade (P < 0.001) and a weak association with positive lymph nodes (P < 0.02). Of the 97 BRCA2-negative MBC cases, we identified one PALB2 mutation with confirmed pathogenicity and one mutation predicted to be pathogenic, a prevalence of pathogenic PALB2-mutation of 1-2%. Based on our results and previous studies, genetic testing for BRCA2 should be recommended for any diagnosed MBC case, regardless of family history of breast cancer.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-010-1195-2

Although with some differences, male and female BC share similar genetic predisposition factors, including BRCA1/2, CHEK2, and PALB2 mutations. As other BRCA1/2 functionally related DNA repair genes, such as CHEK2 and PALB2, BRIP1 is considered a moderate-penetrance BC susceptibility gene. At present, the role of BRIP1 on BC susceptibility in men is unknown. In this study, we aimed to assess whether BRIP1 variants may contribute to male BC (MBC) risk, by screening 97 MBC cases, all negative for BRCA1/2, CHEK2, and PALB2 mutations, selected from a population-based series of 126 MBCs from Central Italy. A total of five BRIP1 germ-line sequence alterations, three coding, and two non-coding variants, were detected in our series. The two non-coding variants IVS4-28G > A and 3'UTR 4049C > T were classified as neutral by in silico analysis. Of the three coding variants, one was a silent variant (E879E) and two resulted in amino acid substitution (R264W and P919S) showing a putative pathogenic role by in silico analysis. However, further analysis of tumor-associated loss of heterozygosity and the frequency of variant alleles, tested in 203 male population controls, suggested a neutral effect for both of these variants. Overall, our results indicate that BRIP1 variants may not play a relevant role in MBC predisposition.

To evaluate the contribution of PALB2 to familial breast cancer in the United States, we sequenced the coding sequences and flanking regulatory regions of the gene from constitutional genomic DNA of 1,144 familial breast cancer patients with wild-type sequences at BRCA1 and BRCA2. Overall, 3.4% (33/972) of patients not selected by ancestry and 0% (0/172) of patients specifically of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry were heterozygous for a nonsense, frameshift, or frameshift-associated splice mutation in PALB2. Mutations were detected in both male and female breast cancer patients. All mutations were individually rare: the 33 heterozygotes harbored 13 different mutations, 5 previously reported and 8 novel mutations. PALB2 heterozygotes were 4-fold more likely to have a male relative with breast cancer (P = 0.0003), 6-fold more likely to have a relative with pancreatic cancer (P = 0.002), and 1.3-fold more likely to have a relative with ovarian cancer (P = 0.18). Compared with their female relatives without mutations, increased risk of developing breast cancer for female PALB2 heterozygotes was 2.3-fold (95% CI: 1.5-4.2) by age 55 and 3.4-fold (95% CI: 2.4-5.9) by age 85. Loss of the wild-type PALB2 allele was observed in laser-dissected tumor specimens from heterozygous patients. Given this mutation prevalence and risk, consideration might be given to clinical testing of PALB2 by complete genomic sequencing for familial breast cancer patients with wild-type sequences at BRCA1 and BRCA2.

We present the diagnostic application of EMMA (Enhanced Mismatch Mutation Analysis (R), Fluigent, Paris, France), a novel method based on heteroduplex analysis by capillary electrophoresis using innovative matrices. BRCA1 and BRCA2 were screened for point mutations and large rearrangements in 1,525 unrelated patients (372 for the validation step and 1,153 in routine diagnosis) using a single analytical condition. Seven working days were needed for complete BRCA1/2 screening in 30 patients by one technician (excluding DNA extraction and sequencing). A total of 137 mutations were found, including a BRCA2 duplication of exons 19 and 20, previously missed by Comprehensive BRACAnalysis (R). The mutation detection rate was 11.9%, which is consistent with patient inclusions. This study therefore suggests that EMMA represents a valuable short-term and midterm option for many diagnostic laboratories looking for an easy, reliable, and affordable strategy, enabling fast and sensitive analysis for a large number of genes.

Thus, the effects of endogenous hormones can be mimicked or, in some cases, completely blocked. A substantial number of environmental pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalates, bisphenol A, pesticides, alkylphenols and heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury), have been shown to disrupt endocrine function. These compounds can cause reproductive problems by decreasing sperm count and quality, increasing the number of testicular germ cells and causing male breast cancer, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, miscarriages, endometriosis, impaired fertility, irregularities of the menstrual cycle, and infertility. Although EDCs may be released into the environment in different ways, the main sources is industrial waste water. The present paper critically reviews the current knowledge of the impact of EDCs on reproductive disorders in humans.

Seventy MBC patients, with a median age of 61 years, were enrolled. The characteristics of MBC were compared in cohort A (1969-1997) and cohort B (1998-2009), and the prognosis was compared between the RM and MRM groups. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma accounted for 81.4% of all cases; 93.7% were estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)-positive. More patients in cohort B accepted multidisciplinary treatment, MRM, adjuvant chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy than those in cohort A; however, the 5-year overall survival rates were similar in the two cohorts. The overall survival curves, locoregional recurrence rates, and systematic metastatic rates were similar in the RM and MRM groups. Currently, more MBC patients receive conservative surgery; MRM may be equally effective as RM for MBC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We screened for LGRs in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in 521 unrelated patients negative for BRCA1/2 point mutations selected from 655 Czech high-risk breast and/or ovarian cancer patients. Besides long range PCR, a chromosome 17-specific oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was used for accurate location of deletions. We identified 14 patients carrying 8 different LGRs in BRCA1 that accounted for 12.3% of all pathogenic BRCA1 mutations. No LGRs were detected in the BRCA2 gene. In a subgroup of 239 patients from high-risk families, we found 12 LGRs (5.0%), whereas two LGRs were revealed in a subgroup of 282 non-familial cancer cases (0.7%). Five LGRs (deletion of exons 1-17, 5-10, 13-19, 18-22 and 21-24) were novel; two LGRs (deletion of exons 5-14 and 21-22) belong to the already described Czech-specific mutations; one LGR (deletion of exons 1-2) was reported from several countries. The deletions of exons 1-17 and 5-14, identified each in four families, represented Czech founder mutations. The present study indicates that screening for LGRs in BRCA1 should include patients from breast or ovarian cancer families as well as high-risk patients with non-familial cancer, in particular cases with early-onset breast or ovarian cancer. On the contrary, our analyses do not support the need to screen for LGRs in the BRCA2 gene. Implementation of chromosome-specific aCGH could markedly facilitate the design of primers for amplification and sequence analysis of junction fragments, especially in deletions overlapping gene boundaries.

Large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) have widened the mutational spectrum of the BRCA1 gene, but the frequencies vary in different populations. In this study, we want to determine the spectrum of LGRs in BRCA1 gene in Nigerian breast cancer patients. The multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay was used to screen BRCA1 rearrangements in 352 patients who previously tested negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 point mutations and small insertions/deletions. Positive MLPA result was confirmed and located by long-range PCR. The breakpoints of the candidate rearrangement were characterized by sequencing. A novel deletion of BRCA1 exon 21 (c.5277 + 480_5332 + 672del) was detected in 1 out of 352 Nigerian breast cancer patients (0.3% occurrence frequency). Further analysis of breakpoints revealed that the deletion involves two Alu-elements: one AluSg in intron 20 and the AluY in intron 21. These data suggest that while BRCA1 genomic rearrangement exists, they do not contribute significantly to BRCA1-associated risk in the Nigerian population.

Therapy side effects include haematologic toxicity (neutropenia, leucopenia), peripheral neuropathy and hypersensitivity, and demonstrate inter-individual variations. Since it is known that three genes are implicated in Taxane turnover, namely ABCB1 in the transport, CYP2C8 in the metabolism and CYP1B1 in the activity, we explored the association among polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) in these three genes and the occurrence of Taxane-induced toxicity. We studied 95 patients affected by breast cancer and under treatment with Taxanes as adjuvant, metastatic or neo-adjuvant therapy. We genotyped them for SNPs in the CYP2C8 (alleles *1, *2, *3 and *4), CYP1B1 (alleles *1 and *3) and ABCB1 (1236 C > T; 2677 G > T/A; 3435 C > T) genes by real-time PCR assay. We observed a significant association between the CYP1B1*3 allele and a lower occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions to Taxane treatment. We speculate that the highest production of 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE2) metabolite by CYP1B1*3 allele could increase the formation of the 4-OHE2-Taxane adduct and possibly inhibit Taxane toxicity. We suggest that CYP1B1 might affect Taxane hypersensitivity therefore representing, if confirmed in a large cohort of patients, an exploratory hypersensitivity predictive biomarker.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-010-1034-5

International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics		2010	NOV 1 2010	78	3	787-792	787	792							Background: Radiation therapy (RT) is indicated for the treatment of local-regionally advanced breast cancer (BCa). Hypothesis: We hypothesized that black and Hispanic patients with local-regionally advanced BCa would receive lower rates of RT than their white counterparts.Methods: The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database was used to identify white, black, Hispanic, and Asian patients with invasive BCa and >= 10 metastatic lymph nodes diagnosed between 1988 and 2005. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression evaluated the relationship of race/ethnicity with use of RT. Multivariate models stratified for those undergoing mastectomy or lumpectomy.Results: Entry criteria were met by 12,653 patients. Approximately half of the patients did not receive RT. Most patients were white (72%); the remainder were Hispanic (10.4%), black (10.3%), and Asian (7.3%). On univariate analysis, Hispanics (odd ratio [OR] 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-1.00) and blacks (OR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70-0.89) were less likely to receive RT than whites. On multivariate analysis, blacks (OR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.86) and Hispanics (OR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.90) were less likely than whites to receive RT. Disparities persisted for blacks (OR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.85) and Hispanics (OR 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.89) who received mastectomy, but not for those who received lumpectomy.Conclusions: Many patients with local-regionally advanced BCa do not receive RT. Blacks and Hispanics were less likely than whites to receive RT. This disparity was noted predominately in patients who received mastectomy. Future efforts at improving rates of RT are warranted. Efforts at eliminating racial/ethnic disparities should focus on black and Hispanic candidates for postmastectomy RT. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The frequency of the mutation varies among populations. The highest frequency has been described in Northern and Eastern European countries; the frequency may be much lower in North America. In this study, our aim was to determine the frequency of CHEK2*1100delC in members of breast cancer families who tested negative for a deleterious mutation in BRCA1/2 at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. We genotyped 102 members from 90 families for CHEK2*1100delC. Most of these families had several cases of breast cancer or ovarian cancer (or both), as well as multiple members with other cancer types in a single lineage. No CHEK2*1100delC mutations were detected in any of the 102 individuals, including 51 women diagnosed with breast cancer at an early age (<45 years), 8 women with bilateral breast cancer, 3 men with breast cancer, and 8 women with ovarian cancer. Our data are consistent with the reported very low frequency of CHEK2*1100delC mutations in North American populations (compared with Northern Europe), rendering CHEK2*1100delC such an unlikely culprit in BRCA1/2 negative families that routine testing of these families appears unwarranted.

The rarity of this entity precludes prospective randomized clinical trials. Although breast carcinoma in both genders share certain characteristics, notable differences have emerged. Familial cases usually have BRCA2 rather than BRCA1 mutations. Klinefelter syndrome is the strongest risk factor for developing male breast carcinoma. Men tend to be diagnosed at an older age than women. Presentation is usually a painless lump, but is often late, with more than 40% of individuals having stage III or IV disease. When survival is adjusted for age at diagnosis and stage of disease, outcomes for male and female patients with breast cancer is similar. Surgery is usually mastectomy with axillary clearance or sentinel node biopsy. Because 90% of tumors are hormonal receptor positive, tamoxifen is standard adjuvant therapy. Indications for radiotherapy and chemotherapy are similar to female breast cancer. For metastatic disease, hormonal therapy is the main treatment, but chemotherapy can also provide palliation.

The aim of this study was to compare the prognosis of MBC and FBC patients in China and the prognosis of MBC and their corresponding postmenopausal FBC patients.Methods Thirty-five MBC patients who were treated at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between 1969 and 2004 were enrolled in the study. Seventy FBC patients who were matched with the MBC patients for TNM stage, year of diagnosis, and age at diagnosis were simultaneously enrolled in the study. A second group comprising 18 MBC patients and their corresponding 36 matched postmenopausal FBC patients were also enrolled. The whole group and the postmenopausal groups were compared for five- and ten-year survivals.Results All the factors that could potentially affect prognosis were comparable among the groups except more FBC than MBC patients underwent endocrine therapy and a modified radical mastectomy. The 5- and 10-year survivals in the whole group were 81.6% and 60.3% for men and 90.7% and 73.5% for women (P=0.02). The 5- and 10-year survival in the postmenopausal group was 82.5% and 100% for men and 66.0% and 85.9% for women (P=0.159).Conclusions Chinese FBC patients had a better prognosis than Chinese MBC patients. However, MBC patients and their corresponding postmenopausal FBC patients had a similar prognosis.

Overall, men experience a worse prognosis than women, probably due to an advanced stage together with the higher age at diagnosis of male patients. Major risk factors for developing male BC include clinical disorders involving hormonal imbalances (excess of estrogen or a deficiency of testosterone as seen in patients with Klinefelter syndrome) and a positive family history for breast cancer. About 90% of male BC are invasive ductal carcinomas. Standard treatment for localized cancer is surgical removal. Adjuvant radiation and systemic therapy are the same as in women with breast cancer. Male BC expresses hormone receptors in about 90% of cases; therefore, tamoxifen is a therapeutic option. A future challenge for the urologist or andrologist is to diagnose the disease at an early stage to improve prognosis.														1433-0563		10.1007/s00120-010-2356-y																		
J	BCI:BCI201000462009	20564105			Breast Cancer in Men in the United States A Population-Based Study of Diagnosis, Treatment, and Survival		Harlan, Linda C. (lh50w@nih.gov) ; Zujewski, Jo Anne; Goodman, Marc T.; Stevens, Jennifer L.									Cancer		2010	AUG 1 2010	116	15	3558-3568	3558	3568							BACKGROUND: Breast cancer in men is rare, so clinical trials are not practical. Recommendations suggest treating men who are diagnosed with breast cancer using the guidelines for postmenopausal women; however, to date, no population-based studies have evaluated patterns of care. METHODS: To examine characteristics, treatment, and survival among men with newly diagnosed breast cancer, in 2003 and 2004, 512 men were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. Data were reabstracted and therapy was verified through the patients' treating physicians. RESULTS: The majority of men (79%) were diagnosed through discovery of a breast lump or other signs/symptoms. Among men who had invasive disease, 86% underwent mastectomy, 37% received chemotherapy, and 58% received hormone therapy. In multivariate analysis, tumor size (P = .01) and positive lymph node status (P < .0001) were associated positively with the use of chemotherapy, whereas age group (P < .0001) and current unmarried status (P = .01) had negative associations. Among men who had invasive, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/borderline tumors, the use of tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (Als) was associated with age group (P = .05). Among men who had invasive disease, cancer mortality was associated with tumor size (P < .0001). Among men with ER-positive/borderline disease, increased cancer mortality was associated with tumor size (P < .0001), current unmarried status (P = .04), and decreased mortality with tamoxifen (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Tumor characteristics and marital status were the primary predictors of therapy and cancer mortality among men with breast cancer. Although Als are not currently recommended, they are commonly prescribed. However, their use did not result in a decrease in cancer mortality. Research must examine the efficacy of Als with and without gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues. Cancer 2010;116;3558-68.

Increases in each tumor marker correlated with larger tumor sizes and nodal involvement. Tumor size, estrogen receptor (ER), and CEA were independent prognostic factors by multivariate analysis in the total group [disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)] as well as in node-positive (NP) and node-negative (NN) patients. Nodal involvement and histological grade were independent prognostic factors in the total group as well as in NP patients. By contrast, adjuvant treatment and CA 15.3 were independent prognostic factors only in NN patients (DFS and OS). All patients with CEA >7.5 mu g/L had recurrence during follow-up. Use of both tumor markers allowed discrimination of the groups of risk in T1 NN patients: 56.3% of recurrences were seen when 1 or both tumor markers were increased, whereas only 9.4% of recurrences were seen in T1 NN patients without increases of either marker.CONCLUSIONS: CEA and CA 15.3 are useful prognostic factors in NP and NN breast cancer patients. CEA >7.5 g/L is associated with a high probability of subclinical metastases.

Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism		2010	JUN 2010	95	6	2536-2559	2536	2559							Objective: Our objective was to update the guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men published previously in 2006.Participants: The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.Conclusions: We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and, in some men in whom total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal or in whom SHBG abnormality is suspected by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using validated assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml or greater than 3 ng/ml in men at high risk for prostate cancer such as African-Americans or men with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer without further urological evaluation, hematocrit greater than 50%, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score above 19, or uncontrolled or poorly controlled heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

Acta Cytologica		2010	MAY-JUN 2010	54	3	259-264	259	264							ObjectiveTo determine the value of cytology in the workup of male breast lesions, important for the management in a same-day breast clinic.Study DesignA total of 146 fine needle aspirations (FNAs) from the male breast were classified in the categories malignant, suspicious, atypical, benign and inadequate. Cytohistologic correlation was done.ResultsHistologic correlation was available in 85 cases. On FNA the 15 malignant cases were classified as malignant (n=11), suspicious for malignancy (n=2) or atypical (n=2). Of the 35 benign lesions on histology 3 cases were classified as atypia and 1 as suspicious for malignancy on FNA. In the inadequate FNAs (n=45), the corresponding histologic specimens were benign, no carcinomas were diagnosed. The sensitivity and specificity of the FNA compared to the definite resection diagnosis were 100% and 90.2%, respectively. The results were comparable with the outcomes of the reviewed studies on male breast lesions in the recent literature.ConclusionBased on the nature of the benign breast lesions in man, a substantial number of inadequate FNAs were obtained. However, due to the good cytohistologic correlations in the group of malignant lesions, we can conclude that cytology remains an important diagnostic tool in the initial workup of male breast carcinomas.

The statistics for male breast cancer (MBC) stand in sharp contrast over the past several decades, there has been a steady rise in the incidence of this disease, and clinical outcome has improved at a much slower pace. In the current review, the clinicopathologic features of MBC are described in detail. An emphasis is placed on molecular profiling of MBC, which may identify candidate biomarkers and putative targets for pharmacologic intervention. The current role of cytotoxic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy (including tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors and GnRH analogues) is defined in the context of currently available studies. Furthermore, the potential role of targeted agents, including HER2-directed therapies, PARP inhibitors, and angiogenesis inhibitors, is delineated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Our study details clinico-pathological features, treatments and prognostic factors in a large French cohort.Material and methods: Four hundred and eighty-nine patients were collected from 1990 to 2005. Median age was 66 years (34% over 70 years) and median follow-up 58 months.Results: According to TN classification, we found T-1: 39%, T-2: 41%, T3T4: 9%, T-x: 11% and N1N2: 27%. Lumpectomy (L) and mastectomy (M) were performed in 8.6% and 91.4% of the cases. Axillary dissection (AD), sentinel node biopsy or both were performed in 90%, 2% and 5% of the cases, respectively. Ninety-five percent of tumours were ductal carcinomas; 47% were pT(1), 20% pT(2) and 33% pT(3)-T-4. Axillary nodal involvement was present in 52.8% cases. ER and PgR were positive in 92% and 89% cases. Radiotherapy (RT) was performed in 85% of the patients. Hormonal treatment (HT) was delivered in 72% of the cases. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors were used in 85% and 12% of the cases; 34% of the patients received chemotherapy (CT).Local recurrence (LIZ), nodal recurrences (NR) and metastases occurred in 2%,5% and 22% of the cases; 2% and 10% developed contralateral BC and second cancer. The 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were 81% and 59%; disease-specific survivals (DSS) were 89% and 72%. Death causes were BC 56%, second cancer 8%, complications 3%, intercurrent disease 15% and unknown 18%. In a univariate analysis, metastatic risk factors were T stage (T1: 19%, T-2: 26%, T3T4: 40%; p=0.013), pN status (pN(0): 12% pN(1-3): 26% pN(>3): 44%; p<0.0001) and presence of locoregional recurrence (62% versus 18% p < 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis, axillary nodal involvement and high SBR remain prognostic factors.Conclusion: Earlier diagnosis and wide use of adjuvant treatments (RT/HT/CT) widely decreased LR and increased survival rates in MBC, reaching female ones. Prognostic factors were also very similar to female ones. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.														1040-8428		10.1016/j.critrevonc.2009.04.002

During the last few years, there has been an increase in the incidence of this disease, along with the increase in female breast cancer (FBC). Little is known about the etiology of MaleBC: hormonal, environmental and genetic factors have been reported to be involved in its pathogenesis. Major risk factors include clinical disorders carrying hormonal imbalances, radiation exposure and, in particular, a positive family history (FH) for BC, the latter suggestive of genetic susceptibility. Rare mutations in high-penetrance genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) confer a high risk of BC development; low-penetrance gene mutations (i.e. CHEK-2) are more common but involve a lower risk increase.About 90% of all male breast tumors have proved to be invasive ductal carcinomas, expressing high levels of hormone receptors with evident therapeutic returns.The most common clinical sign of BC onset in men is a painless palpable retroareolar lump, which should be evaluated by means of mammography, ultrasonography and core biopsy or fine needle aspiration (FNA).To date, there are no published data from prospective randomized trials supporting a specific therapeutic approach in MaleBC. Tumor size together with the number of axillary nodes involved are the main prognostic factors and should guide the treatment choice. Locoregional approaches include surgery and radiotherapy (RT), depending upon the initial clinical presentation. When systemic treatment (adjuvant, neoadjuvant and metastatic) is delivered, the choice between hormonal and or chemotherapy (CT) should depend upon the clinical and biological features, according to the FBC management guidelines. However great caution is required because of high rates of age-related comorbidities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	BCI:BCI201000370893	20397767			Male breast cancer: A survey at the Helsinki University Central Hospital during 1981-2006		Liukkonen, Sanna; Saarto, Tiina; Maenpaa, Hanna; Sjostrom-Mattson, Johanna (johanna.mattson@fimnet.fi)									Acta Oncologica (Stockholm)		2010		49	3	322-327	322	327							Background. The purpose was to analyze the behavior of male breast cancer. Methods. Fifty-eight male breast cancer patients were treated at the HUGH during 1981-2006. Data on risk factors, tumor characteristics, clinical presentation, treatment and survival were obtained by chart review. Results. Presentation occurred at a median age of 63 years, most often due to a self-detected lump. The median size of the primary tumor was 1.8 cm and 14% were T4 tumors. Forty-seven percent had lymph node metastases and 4% distant metastases at diagnosis. Ductal carcinoma was the most common tumor type. All tumors with known receptor status were positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and 79% for progesterone receptor (PgR). Her-2 overexpression was found in 2/19 patients (11%). A family history of breast cancer, obesity, high alcohol intake and liver cirrhosis were the most often seen risk factors. Nineteen percent had one or two other malignancies, the most common second malignancy being prostate cancer in 7%. Ninety-seven percent were operated by mastectomy and 90% by axillary evacuation while sentinel node biopsy alone was done only in 7%. Sixty percent of the patients received radiotherapy, 64% adjuvant hormonal treatment, 20% adjuvant chemotherapy, and 2% adjuvant trastuzumab. Fourteen patients (25%) experienced a relapse of which 60% were distant, bone being the most common site. During follow-up 21 patients (37%) died, of whom nine of breast cancer and 12 due to other causes. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 75%. Conclusions. Male breast cancer behaves and is today treated in many respects like postmenopausal breast cancer. However, due to rudimentary breast tissue the symptoms, diagnosis and especially a higher amount of T4 tumors differ from that of females. Also the risk factor profile and histologic subgroups seem different. The 5-year OS of 75% is clearly higher than 44% reported at our institution in 1982.														0284-186X	1651-226X	10.3109/02841861003591723

Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) provides a method to quantitatively measure the changes of DNA copy number and to map them directly onto the complete linear genome sequences. The aim of this study was to investigate DNA imbalances by aCGH and compare them with a female breast cancer dataset.Methods: We used Agilent Human Genome CGH Microarray Kit 44B and 44K to compare genomic alterations in 25 male breast cancer tissues studied at NCC of Bari and 16 female breast cancer deposited with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE12659). Data analysis was performed with Nexus Copy Number 5.0 software.Results: All the 25 male and 16 female breast cancer samples displayed some chromosomal instability (110.93 alterations per patient in female, 69 in male). However, male samples presented a lower frequency of genetic alterations both in terms of loss and gains.Conclusion: aCGH is an effective tool for analysis of cytogenetic aberrations in MBC, which involves different biological processes than female. Male most significant altered regions contained genes involved in cell communication, cell division and immunological response, while female cell-cell junction maintenance, regulation of transcription and neuron development.

Daniel; Gierach, Gretchen L.; McGlynn, Katherine A.; Gridley, Gloria									Breast Cancer Research and Treatment		2010	JAN 2010	119	1	185-192	185	192							The etiology of male breast cancer is largely unknown, reflecting its relative rarity. Although a number of previous studies have suggested relationships with a variety of medical conditions, the results have largely derived from case-control studies and may reflect recall biases. Within the large U.S. Veterans Affairs computerized medical care system database, we had the opportunity to access 26 million hospital discharge records over the period 1969-1996 and to relate various documented medical conditions to the risk of subsequent male breast cancer. This allowed us to calculate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for male breast cancer associated with conditions occurring one or more years after initial hospitalization, adjusted for age, race, calendar year, duration of follow-up, and number of hospital visits. Among 4,501,578 men aged 18-100 years, a total of 642 cases of primary male breast cancer were identified (523 among whites, 119 among blacks). Medical conditions that were significantly related to risk were diabetes (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.60), obesity (1.98, 1.55-2.54), orchitis/epididymitis (1.84, 1.10-3.08), Klinefelter syndrome (29.64, 12.26-71.68), and gynecomastia (5.86, 3.74-9.17). Additionally, among black patients, cholelithiasis emerged as a significant risk predictor (3.45, 1.59-7.47). Diseases that have previously been related to male breast cancer risk that were not supported by our study results included thyroid diseases, smoking-related conditions, liver cirrhosis, prostatic hyperplasia, and fractures. After adjustment for obesity, the association with diabetes disappeared, but that with gynecomastia persisted. In multivariate models that simultaneously considered all important medical predictors of risk, significant risks were seen for Klinefelter syndrome (16.83, 6.81-41.62), gynecomastia (5.08, 3.21-8.03), obesity (1.91, 1.50-2.44), and orchitis/epididymitis (1.80, 1.08-3.01). These results support previous speculations that male breast cancer is influenced not only by tissue at risk, but also by hormonal and inflammatory factors.

Journal of Environmental Pathology Toxicology and Oncology		2010		29	3	235-244	235	244							Background: We report our findings on a hospital-based retrospective pilot cohort with case-controls study, which we carried out to examine genetic, environmental, and occupational risk factors in men with breast cancer. Methods: 86 men with breast cancer were diagnosed in eight VA medical centers that agreed to collaborate on this project. A case-control analysis was conducted on a subset of the male breast cancer cases (n = 44) and age- and ethnicity-matched controls (n = 77). We compared host characteristics, comorbidities, and medications intake between cases and controls by using Chi-square analysis and Fisher's exact test. Results: The descriptive analysis showed that the majority of veterans with male breast cancer were non-Hispanic white (60%), older than 65 years at diagnosis (56%), and more likely estrogen receptor positive (45%). World War II veterans represented the largest group (22%), followed by the Vietnam era veterans (10%). Thirty-three percent reported a positive family history of cancer, while 18% had another primary cancer diagnosis. Prior alcohol (43%) and tobacco use (56%) was substantial among these patients. Twenty percent of patients were overweight or obese and 55% had comorbid diseases with heart disease being the most prevalent, followed by diabetes mellitus. The case-control analysis yielded a significantly greater proportion of cases with gynecomastia (p < 0.0001), a positive family history of cancer (p = 0.0028), history of antibiotic use (p = 0.0112), and history of tobacco use (p = 0.0143) compared to controls. Conclusion: The findings of this hospital-based pilot study indicate case-control differences in gynecomastia and family history of cancer. The pilot study lacked sufficient power to determine a true association between the variables of interest and warrants a large-scale collaborative study between the VA medical centers.														0731-8898	2162-6537	10.1615/JEnvironPatholToxicolOncol.v29.i3.60

The objective of this study is to compare the characteristics and treatment pattern of male breast cancer patients with comparable Subgroups of female breast cancer patients using data submitted to the National Breast Cancer Audit.This is a retrospective analysis of 151 male breast cancers diagnosed and treated between 2000 and 2008. Most of the male early breast cancer cases in this group were symptomatic ones in men aged > 50 years with one invasive turnout. There was a similar proportion of lymph node positive cancer among males and females, although male breast cancer was more likely to be unifocal (P = 0.007) and oestrogen receptor positive (P = 0.001). Male breast cancer patients almost always underwent mastectomy and a significant proportion of them (11%) received no surgical treatment. There were no differences in axillary surgery although males were more likely to undergo a level 2 axillary surgery and less likely to have sentinel node biopsy. Male patients were significantly less likely to undergo radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for oestrogen receptor positive tumours.Conclusion: While the female oriented treatment guidelines are available, male patients with early breast cancer received different surgical and adjuvant treatment from comparable females.

(smilham2@comcast.net)									Medical Hypotheses		2009	NOV 2009	73	5	788-789	788	789							Recent reviews and reports of cancer incidence and mortality in firefighters conclude that they are at an increased risk of a number of cancers. These include leukemia, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, male breast cancer, malignant melanoma, and cancers of the brain, stomach, colon, rectum, prostate, urinary bladder, testes, and thyroid. Firefighters are exposed to a long list of recognized or probable carcinogens in combustion products and the presumed route of exposure to these carcinogens is by inhalation. Curiously, respiratory system cancers and diseases are usually not increased in firefighters as they are in workers exposed to known inhaled carcinogens. The list of cancers with increased risk in firefighters strongly overlaps the list of cancers at increased risk in workers exposed to electromagnetic fields (EMF) and radiofrequency radiation (RFR). Firefighters have increased exposure to RFR in the course of their work, from the mobile two-way radio communications devices which they routinely use while fighting fires, and at times from firehouse and fire vehicle radio transmitters. I suggest that some of the increased cancer risk in firefighters is caused by RFR exposure, and is therefore preventable. The precautionary principle should be applied to reduce the risk of cancer in firefighters, and workman's compensation rules will necessarily need to be modified. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A case of vertebral body fracture due to metastatic breast cancer in a male patient and a review of the literature are presented.Objective. To draw attention to the possible adverse skeletal events in breast cancer patients, and the need of a watchful staff within the multidisciplinary team in charge.Summary of Background Data. Breast cancer is a rare condition in men, the male/female ratio is 1 of 100 approximately; in both sexes bone metastases are the most common. The pathologic fracture by spinal metastases can cause intense pain with difficult management. Vertebroplasty has been used successfully to treat pain and improve functional status in patients with vertebral compression fractures due to metastases.Methods. A 43-year-old male patient was diagnosed of having breast epithelial carcinoma after histologic analysis of a femur fracture. Following reconstruction, the patient started rehabilitative treatment. In a control visit, he referred sudden cervical pain which was initially treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and rest. The patient was seen in a later visit and complained about poor response to analgesia. For this reason, a radiologic study was carried out, showing signs of fracture of the third cervical vertebral body (C3), and was completed with magnetic resonance imaging where the diagnosis of osteolytic metastasis was confirmed.Results. After consulting the interventionist radiology team, vertebroplasty was carried out aiming to diminishing the pain. There were no postoperative complications and the patient's recovery from cervicalgia permitted the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs suspension. Two weeks after the vertebroplasty, the patient resumed his rehabilitative treatment without presenting cervical pain or mobility limitation.Conclusion. Spinal metastases treatment may include combinations of radiotherapy, vertebroplasty, and bisphosphonates, which have proved analgesic effect and a decrease of bone complications; however, out of these options, only vertebroplasty allows rapid stabilization and analgesia.														0362-2436		10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181aa2687

Male patients who had a diagnosis of carcinoma on breast biopsy or resection were identified, and detailed chart review was done to assess demographics and correlate biopsy and FNA results.ResultsA total of 346,792 patients' charts were searched, and 2.17 male patients were found to have had abreast mass and subsequent FNA. Combined in both institutions, FNA results were positive for carcinoma in 12 (5.5%) cases, negative in 181 (83.4%) cases, suspicions in 5 (2.3%) cases, indeterminate inconclusive in 3 (1.4%) cases and unsatisfactory in 16 (7.4%) cases. Matching biopsies to confirm FNA results were available in 26 (12%) of the 217 cases. The calculated sensitivity and specificity for the malignant cases reached 100%. When suspicions cases were calculated for diagnostic accuracy, the sensitivity was 67% and the specificity 100%.ConclusionThis biinstitutional study demonstrates that FNA is a reliable but underutilized procedure for the management of male breast lesions.

To learn more about its epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, genetics and pathology in our country, we conducted a retrospective study of all cases seen in recent decades at our institution.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified each case of male breast cancer in the database at the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, Kashmir, India, between the years 1983 to 2007.RESULTS: We identified only 32 cases of male breast cancer over the 24-year period. Male breast cancer accounted for 32 (2.8%) of 1141 resected breast specimens, which included all breast lesions and 32 (4.1%) of 780 breast cancer cases. Of the 32 cases, 20 (62.5%) had various associated risk factors. Invasive ductal carcinoma was seen in 30 cases (93.7%). Of 20 cases that underwent molecular studies, 16 (80%) patients had estrogen receptor positivity whereas 14 (70%) had progesterone receptor positivity. Six cases (30%) overexpressed HER2 and p53. The BRCA2 mutation was observed in 4 cases (40%) while no patient presented with the BRCA1 mutation.CONCLUSION: An incidence of 4.1% for male breast cancer indicates that this disease is not as uncommon as presumed in this part of the world. Breast cancer in men seems more frequently to be hormone receptor positive and the BRCA2 mutation confers a significant risk to men.														0256-4947

Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 also are associated with male breast cancer (MBC). Similarly, it had been suggested in the original CHEK2 identification report that the CHEK2 1100delC mutation confers an increased risk for MBC. Here, we have evaluated the risk of CHEK2 1100delC for MBC by genotyping CHEK2 1100delC in 23 familial and 71 unselected Dutch MBC cases. None of the 23 familial MBC cases carried the CHEK2 1100delC mutation. In contrast, CHEK2 1100delC was present in 3 of the 71 (4.2%) unselected MBC cases, which was significantly more prevalent than the 1.1% Dutch population frequency assessed in 1,692 individuals (P = 0.05, OR = 4.1, 95% CI 1.2-14.3). Our data suggest that, in the Netherlands, CHEK2 1100delC is associated with an increased risk for MBC.														0167-6806	1573-7217	10.1007/s10549-008-0162-7

Genetic Testing and Molecular Biomarkers		2009	JUN 2009	13	3	395-398	395	398							Purpose: Patients attending familial cancer clinics may find the term "mutation'' offensive and potentially stigmatizing, yet there is little consensus in the literature as to the most appropriate alternative terms to describe a cancer-related mutation to individuals considering genetic testing for cancer risk. This study aimed to describe a cancer-related mutation in a rare group of familial cancer clinic patients: men at increased risk of carrying a breast cancer-related mutation. Methods: Twenty-seven men completed a self-report questionnaire that assessed their preferences for language to describe a cancer-related mutation. Results: Overall, men were most likely to spontaneously suggest the term "faulty gene'' to describe a cancer-related mutation when asked an open-ended question about their language preferences. When asked to rate the term "faulty gene'' in comparison to the terms "altered gene,'' "mutation,'' "nonworking gene,'' "malfunctioning gene,'' and "gene change,'' the term "faulty gene'' received the highest mean preference rating in this sample of men at increased risk of developing breast cancer. Conclusion: This area of investigation remains controversial and would benefit from more formal and larger-scale investigations of the language preferences of individuals at increased risk of developing cancer.

SMJ Singapore Medical Journal		2009	MAY 2009	50	5	519-521	519	521							Introduction: Breast cancer is a rare condition among men with a reported incidence of about one percent. Nevertheless, it is thought to behave similarly in both genders. Due to its rarity, male breast cancer is not widely reported, especially in the Asian population.Methods: In a five-year review of our breast cancer surgery series, about 1.6 percent involved male patients. There was a substantial delay in presentation among those men, whose mean age at presentation was 64 years.Results: The majority of patients presented with a painless lump. Histologically, all tumours were ductal in origin and all patients had lower than stage III malignancies. The majority of patients underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. All male patients were commenced on adjuvant tamoxifen. The longest survival was 54 months with all patients remaining tumour-free.Conclusion: Malaysian men are at risk of breast cancer and seem to have a better prognosis.														0037-5675

As compared to women breast cancer, MBC has some similarities and also some particularities related to age, comorbidities, breast volume, diagnostic delay, prognosis and survival. Modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with axillary dissection is the gold standard. Sentinel lymph node dissection is a promising option for early stages. Adjuvant radiation is proposed because of the high frequency of node involvement and central tumor location. In hormone receptor positive tumors tamoxifen remains the gold standard endocrine therapy because of the lack of data on aromatase inhibitors. Adjuvant chemotherapy can be proposed to high-risk patients while trastuzumab should be an option in breast cancer that overexpresses HER2. In the setting of considerable evolution in the management of women breast cancer, this review aimed to point out on the similarities and particularities of MBC and the future challenges to improve MBC outcome.														0007-4551	1769-6917	10.1684/bdc.2008.0813

Due to rarity of the disease, no detail information about biomarkers and drug targets available and because of late diagnosis and rarely understood the pathogenesis at molecular level, the treatment of MBC is also not yet standardized. Though the MBC biology, pathogenesis, and the clinical outcomes resembles with female breast cancer (FBC), they are quite unique in many aspects. Therefore, the uses of FBC specific drugs for treatment of MBC are not only dissatisfactory but also increases mortality rate due to severe side effects of these conventional drugs. To avoid side effects of usual therapeutic drugs, new drugs and their targets should be identified and evaluated, where the dietary phytochemicals may be the alternative of currently used drugs. Similarly, an integrated strategy and pharmacogenomics approach is now essential to fight against this malady. This article will deal with different aspects of MBC including biomarkers, pathways, drug targets, and common dietary phytochemicals as effective alternatives of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs for targeted therapy without any side effect.

Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 20 MBC patients in comparison with female ductal carcinoma treated at Yonsei University Severance Hospital from July 1985 to May 2007. Clinicopathological features, treatment patterns, and survival were investigated. Results: MBC consists of 0.38% of all breast cancers. The median age was 56 years. The median symptom duration was 10 months. The median tumor size was 1.7cm, 27.8% showed node metastasis, and 71.4% were estrogen receptor positive. All 20 cancers were arisen from ductal cells. No lobular carcinoma was found. The incidence of stages 0, 1, 11, and III in patients were 2, 10, 4, and 3, respectively. All patients underwent mastectomy. One with invasive cancer did not receive axillary node dissection and stage was not exactly evaluated. Adjuvant treatments were determined by pathologic parameters and stage. Clinicopathological parameters and survival rates of MBC were comparable to those of female ductal carcinoma. Conclusion: The onset age of MBC was 10 years older and symptom duration was longer than in female patients. No difference in outcomes between MBC and female ductal carcinoma suggests that the biology of MBC is not different from that of females. Therefore, education, an appropriate system for early detection, and adequate treatment are necessary for improving outcomes.														0513-5796	1976-2437	10.3349/ymj.2008.49.6.978

In the prospective National Institutes of Health AARP Diet and Health Study, we studied 324 920 men, among whom 121 developed breast cancer. Men who reported a first-degree relative with breast cancer had an increased risk of breast cancer (relative risk [RR] = 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19 to 3.09). Among the medical conditions examined, a new finding emerged regarding increased male breast cancer risk associated with a history of a bone fracture (RR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.24 to 3.91). Obesity was positively related to risk (RR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.10 to 2.91, for body mass indices of = 30 vs <25 kg/m(2)) and physical activity inversely related, even after adjustment for body mass index. Smokers were at somewhat elevated risk, although trends with smoking characteristics were inconsistent. Alcohol consumption was not related to risk. The identified risk factors show some commonalities with female breast cancer and indicate the importance of hormonal mechanisms. Differences in risk factors may reflect unique mechanisms associated with androgens and their ratio to bioavailable estrogens.

Germ-line mutations of BRCA2 and, to lesser extent, BRCA1 genes are the highest risk factors associated with MBC. Interestingly, BRCA2 germ-line rearrangements have been described in high-risk breast/ovarian cancer families which included at least one MBC case. Germ-line mutations of CHEK2 gene have been also implicated in inherited MBC predisposition. The CHEK2 1100delC mutation has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer in men lacking BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Intriguingly, two other CHEK2 mutations (IVS2+1G > A and I157T) and a CHEK2 large genomic deletion (del9-10) have been associated with an elevated risk for prostate cancer. Here, we investigated the contribution of BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 alterations to MBC predisposition in Italy by analysing a large series of MBC cases, unselected for breast cancer family history and all negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 germ-line mutations. A total of 102 unrelated Italian MBC cases were screened for deletions/duplications of BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. No BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 genomic rearrangements, including the CHEK2 del9-10, were found in the series analysed. Furthermore, none of the MBC cases and 263 male population controls, also included in this study, carried the CHEK2 1100delC, IVS2+1G > A and I157T common mutations. Overall, our data suggest that screening of BRCA1/2 rearrangements is not advantageous in MBC cases not belonging to high-risk breast cancer families and that common CHEK2 mutations play an irrelevant role in MBC predisposition in Italy.

Some inherited cases are due to the mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. There is no information available about the frequency of BRCA gene mutations in Slovenian MBC population. The purpose of this study was to characterize BRCA germline mutations in Slovenian MBC patients. Forty-one patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana between 1970 and 2006 were proposed to take part in this study. Of them, 27 agreed to follow a genetic counseling session and 25 patients agreed to provide a blood sample for genetic testing. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes from the MBC patients were screened for four highly recurrent mutations in the Slovenian population. When an additional breast cancer case or an ovarian cancer was present in the family, a more extended analysis was performed. No BRCA1 mutations were found. A BRCA2 gene mutation was identified in four MBC patients. Three of them carried the Slovenian founder mutation IVS16-2A>G. All four mutations were confined to the patients with a family history of breast cancer. Among the MBC patients with a family history of breast cancer in the first-or second-degree relatives, the frequency of BRCA2 gene mutation was 50%. The median age of the patients with a BRCA2 gene mutation was 60 years, not significantly different from those without a mutation. The BRCA2 mutations were diagnosed in 16% of our MBC patients.

Male breast cancer has a peak incidence at the age of 71 years.There are no randomized data giving information on the optimal therapy for male breast cancer patients, thereby limiting firmer conclusions.The preferred primary surgical therapy is modified radical/simple mastectomy, but breast-conserving surgery has also been used in males. Post-operative radiotherapy should be used on a more routine basis; as males have shorter breast-anatomical distances and males are diagnosed at a later stage compared with females. The so far preferred adjuvant therapy modality has been tamoxifen for patients with endocrine responsive disease. The use of aromatase inhibitors in males is more controversial, since they may not deplete the estradiol levels sufficiently. Different chemotherapy regimens have been used in the adjuvant and metastatic setting. The use of adjuvant therapy has in institutional and review comparisons been demonstrated to result in an improved outcome. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Their incidence in the population is relatively low, however, and it is highly unusual to identify individuals with two or more inherited cancer gene mutations. We describe a family with multiple cases of MEN1-associated cancers as well as pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, and male breast cancer, in which we identified germline mutations in both MEN1 and BRCA2. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with both MEN1 and BRCA2 mutations and with a personal history of hyperparathyroidism and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

(trebla_albert@hotmail.com)									Breast		2007	JUN 2007	16	3	323-325	323	325							Less than 1% of breast cancers occur in mates, and the optimal hormonal therapy in this setting is unknown. Tamoxifen is effective in this entity, but unfortunately there is little information on aromatase inhibitors (AI) or fulvestrant. It has been suggested that the association of Al and GnRh analogues and Al could block the two routes of oestrogen production in mates, and therefore this approach could increase efficacy. However, it could also enhance the rate of adverse events (hot flashes, sexual impotence, etc.). In this report we report 11 months of progression-free survival, without any adverse events, in a patient who received trastuzumab and anastrozole therapy. We conclude that this combination is a reasonable option in men with ER+ and Her2+ advanced breast cancer. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

(patricia.tonin@mcgill.ca)									Clinical Genetics		2006	OCT 2006	70	4	320-329	320	329							The BRCAPRO, Couch, Myriad I and II, Ontario Family History Assessment Tool (FHAT), and Manchester models have been used to predict BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carrier status of women at high risk for developing the heritable form of breast and ovarian cancers. We have evaluated these models for their accuracy in classifying 224 French Canadian families with at least three cases of breast cancer (diagnosed before the age of 65 years), ovarian cancer, or male breast cancer where mutation status was known for an index affected case used to assess the model. This series includes 44 BRCA1 and 52 BRCA2 mutation-positive families. Using receiver operator characteristics analyses, the C-statistics were found to be 0.81, 0.80, 0.79, and 0.74 for the BRCAPRO, FHAT, Manchester, and Myriad II models, respectively, when incorporating both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carrier predictions. For the BRCAPRO model, 75% scored greater than a 0.43 probability in the mutation-positive group and 75% scored less than 0.50 in the mutation-negative group. Only 38 of 128 (30%) mutation-negative group had a probability greater than 0.43 with the BRCAPRO model. While all models were highly predictive of carrier status, the BRCAPRO model was the most accurate where a cut-off of 10% would have eliminated 60 of 128 (47%) mutation-negative families for genetic testing and only miss 10 of 96 (10%) mutation-positive families. A review of the cancer phenotypes with high BRCAPRO probabilities showed that significantly more metachronous bilateral breast cancer cases occurred in BRCA1/2 mutation carrier families in comparison to mutation-negative families, a feature which is not discriminated in the BRCAPRO model.

Karlsson, Camilla Thellenberg; Malmer, Beatrice; Wiklund, Fredrik; Gronberg, Henrik (henrik.gronberg@ki.se)									Journal of Urology		2006	AUG 2006	176	2	538-543	538	543							Purpose: In a large population based study we reported an increased risk of male breast cancer after prostate cancer. In the current study we performed a comprehensive investigation of whether treatment for prostate cancer and/or family history is responsible for the excess risk.Materials and Methods: This study had 2 parts. 1) We performed a nested case-control study in 41 men who had previously been identified with first prostate cancer, followed by male breast cancer and in 81 matched controls with prostate cancer only. The medical records of these men were retrieved and clinical data such as stage, grade and treatment were extracted. 2) We also performed a family study including relatives of men with a diagnosis of prostate as well as breast cancer, irrespective of which was first. The 878 relatives were identified through parish offices and linked to the Swedish Cancer Registry to evaluate the occurrence of breast, prostate and other cancers and calculate if there were any excess risks for different cancers.Results: Cases with prostate plus breast cancer received estrogen treatment more often than controls with prostate cancer only (p = 0.03). The period of estrogen treatment was longer in the cases, although it was not statistically significant. Mean time from prostate cancer diagnosis to breast cancer diagnosis was 47.6 months. Cases and controls did not differ in grade or stage. In the family study an increased risk of prostate cancer was found in relatives (SIR 2.14, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.18). For other cancers no significantly increased risks were found. In 2 families pedigree analysis using the BRCAPRO program (http://www3.utsouthwestern.edu/cancergene/) revealed an estimated 100% and 49% probability in families 1 and 2, respectively, that the proband was a BRCA2 carrier.Conclusions: Our data suggest that most of the increased risk of breast cancer following prostate cancer can be explained by estrogen treatment. However, in a small number of men with prostate as well as breast cancer pedigree analysis suggests that BRCA2 mutation might be the underlying cause.														0022-5347		10.1016/j.juro.2006.03.036

A.									Breast		2006	JUN 2006	15	3	399-409	399	409							Breast cancer is a very common disease in Nigeria. It is often associated with a poor prognosis for a variety of reasons. This study was designed to investigate the challenges, severity, outcome and factors influencing the outcome of the management of breast cancer in a Nigerian Teaching Hospital with a view to finding ways to improve the current dismal outlook for patients with the disease. The clinical records of patients seen with breast cancer over an 8-year period (1996-2003) in the two units of the Teaching hospital were reviewed. The two units serve the urban, semi-urban and rural communities of some parts of southwestern Nigeria. Two hundred and twelve patients with breast cancer were seen over the 8-year period of the study. The mean age was 48 years (23-85 years). There were 211 female and one male. One hundred and three patients (48.7%) had either postprimary or tertiary education. A proportion of 66.7% were premenopausal, 79.2% had pregnancy early in life and were multi-parous. These also gave a history of prolonged breast-feeding of their children. The tumour was self-detected in 195 (92%). The mean duration of symptoms was 11.2 months (9 days-7 years). Pain in 100 patients (47%) was the most common symptom and the cancer was in the left breast in 113 (53.3%). Localized cancer was in the upper outer quadrant in 85 (40%), whereas the whole breast was involved in 55 patients (26%). Loco-regional features of advanced cancer were seen in 157 patients (74%). The tumour was fungating in 83 (39%) and there was clinical evidence of systemic metastasis in 28 patients (13%). One hundred and seventy-four (80.6%) patients had advanced disease (stages 3 and 4). Definitive surgery was possible in 185 patients (87.3%), neoadjuvant chemotherapy was required in 65 (30.6%), postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in 178 (84%; drug combinations were CMF-cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5fluorouracil, CMFP-CMF plus prednisone, and CAF-cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil), tamoxifen was administered in all the patients. Only 70 (33.2%) patients were known to have received radiotherapy among those referred to the Radiotherapy unit, with associated fair treatment compliance after surgery. Outpatient clinic attendance was also very poor, only 27 (12.7%) were still being seen in the clinic, 83 patients (39%) were known to be dead and 102 patients were lost to follow-up. The mean follow-up period was 8.4 months (1 week-6 years). In conclusion, breast cancer is very common in our area of practice in Nigeria; the majority of our patients were young and premenopausal women presenting in the advanced stages of cancer. Treatment compliance was very poor. The majority of the patients were dead or lost to follow-up within a year of diagnosis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It is possible that, because male patients are unaware of male breast cancer, there is a delay of diagnosis and, consequently, more advanced stages are commonly encountered in these patients. Some studies have engaged in molecular studies of male breast cancers because of the possibly different characteristics, prognosis, and treatment between male and female malignancies. However, a dearth of studies still exists, most likely because of the rarity of the disease and lack of a large patient base for study. Among the molecular markers of breast cancer, p53, Ki-67, HER-2/neu, and Bcl-2 are the most frequently studied. Here we present two rare cases and a review of the literature concerning the relationship between immunohistochemical markers and their impact in order to provide surgeons with more information about the disease and further techniques for treatment of these patients.														1607-551X

Atlanta (GA): American Cancer Society; 2005]. The rarity of MBC has precluded major progress in the understanding and treatment of this disease. Treatment has often been extrapolated from female breast cancer (FBC) despite distinct clinicopathologic features between the two entities, especially with regards to the role of mate hormones and estrogens in this disease. Also, it is uncertain if hormone receptor positive tumors carry the same prognostic implication in MBC as in the female disease. Hormonal therapy has been the mainstay of treatment in MBC with tamoxifen the front-tine drug. The role of the newer generation aromatase inhibitors has not been well defined but they are being used in clinical practice for the treatment of MBC, based on accepted data for women with the disease. This commentary focuses on the major hormonal differences between mate and female breast cancer that would suggest the need to explore different treatment strategies if significant advances are to be made in the understanding and treatment of this distinct disease.

Lancet (North American Edition)		2006	FEB 18 2006	367	9510	595-604	595	604							Occurrence of male breast cancer, a rare disease, peaks at age 71 years. Familial cases usually have BRCA2 rather than BRCA1 mutations. Occupational risks include high temperature environments and exhaust fumes, but electromagnetic fields have not been implicated. Hyperoestrogenisation resulting from Klinefelter's, gonadal dysfunction, obesity, or excess alcohol, all increase risk as does exposure to radiation, whereas gynaecomastia does not. Presentation is usually a lump or nipple inversion, but is often late, with more than 40% of individuals having stage III or IV disease. Most tumours are ductal and 10% are ductal carcinoma in situ. Surgery is usually mastectomy with axillary clearance or sentinel node biopsy. Indications for radiotherapy, by stage, are similar to female breast cancer. Because 90% of tumours are oestrogen-receptor-positive, tamoxifen is standard adjuvant therapy, but some individuals could also benefit from chemotherapy. Hormonal therapy is the main treatment for metastatic disease, but chemotherapy can also provide palliation. National initiatives are increasingly needed to improve information and support for male breast cancer patients.														0140-6736	1474-547X	10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68226-3

In male firefighters, mortality due to all causes and most nonmalignant diseases was significantly less than expected. There was no excess overall mortality from cancer but excesses existed for male breast cancer [standardized mortality ratio (SMR = 7.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.99-18.96) and thyroid cancer (SMR = 4.82; 95% CI: 1.30-12.34)]. Mortality from bladder cancer was increased and approached statistical significance (SMR = 1.79; 95% CI: 0.98-3.00). Firefighters certified between 1972 and 1976 had excess mortality from bladder cancer (SMR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.04-3.33). Female firefighters had similar morality patterns to Florida women except for atherosclerotic heart disease (SMR = 3.85; 95% CI: 1.66-7.58).Conclusions Excess mortality risk from bladder cancer may be related to occupational exposure during firefighting. The thyroid cancer and breast cancer risk in males, as well as the excess risk of cardiovascular disease mortality noted in females warrant further investigation.

Although the epidemiologic literature regarding female breast cancer is extensive, relatively little is known about the etiology of male breast cancer (MBC). This review is intended to summarize the existing body of evidence on genetic and epidemiologic risk factors for breast cancer in men. Overall, the epidemiology of MBC presents similarities with the epidemiology of female breast cancer. Major genetic factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for men include BRCA2 mutations, which are believed to account for the majority of inherited breast cancer in men, Klinefelter syndrome, and a positive family history. Suspected genetic factors include AR gene mutations, CYP17 polymorphism, Cowden syndrome, and CHEK2. Epiderniologic risk factors for MBC include disorders relating to hormonal imbalances, such as obesity, testicular disorders (e.g., cryptorchidism, mumps orchitis, and orchiectomy), and radiation exposure. Suspected epidemiologic risk factors include prostate cancer, prostate cancer treatment, gynecomastia, occupational exposures (e.g., electromagnetic fields, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and high temperatures), dietary factors (e.g., meat intake and fruit and vegetable consumption), and alcohol intake.														1055-9965

To date, a review on male breast cancer (MBC) has not been published in an andrological journal. The papers underlying this review were published from authors of different institutions: Clinical Genetics, Dermatology, Gynaecology, Internal Medicine, Oncology, Pathology, Psychiatry, Radiology and Surgery. MBC accounts for approximately 1% of breast cancer patients. A total of 182 men died of breast cancer in 1999, in Germany. In the US, 1500 new cases per year occur. MBC accounts for <5% of surgically removed breast lumps. Diseases with increased oestrogen action increase the risk of MBC. Mutations of distinct genes are estimated to account for up to roughly 10% of MBC. BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are responsible for approximately 80% of the families with hereditary breast cancer. The diagnosis of MBC is not possible without histological examination. Different diagnostic procedures such as clinical diagnosis, sonography, mammography, fine-needle biopsy and core needle facilitate the decision whether a biopsy is necessary.														0303-4569		10.1111/j.1439-0272.2004.00639.x

Recently, we identified pathogenetic BRCA1/2 mutations in a population-based series of Italian MBC patients: here in, we investigated interactions between a carrier status for BRCA1/2 mutations and occupation using a case-case design and estimating case-only odds ratios (CORs). Truck-driving was the most frequent occupation (3/4 BRCA-related cases and 2/19 unrelated cases). An interaction between carrier status and working as a truck-driver emerged, when we classified MBC cases as "ever/never-held" this job title (COR 25.5; 95% Confidence Limits (CL): 1.1-1,412.5) or according to truck-driving as the "longest-held" work (COR 54.0; 95% CL: 1.62,997.5). The possible modifying effect on MBC risk in subjects carrying BRCA1/2 germ-line mutations of an occupation characterised by exposure to chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) that are capable of inducing DNA damage, may provide clues to the role of environmental exposures in modifying BC risk in mutation carriers in both genders.

For example, amplification and overexpression of the ERBB2 oncogene is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer and ERBB2 serves as a target for antibody-based therapy. Current knowledge on the pathogenesis,of male breast cancer (MBC) is limited. The purpose of our study was to investigate the potential relevance of a series of genes known to be amplified in female breast cancer (FBC) in a the development and pathogenesis of MBC. To this end, we applied fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to the analysis of 128 breast tumors from males. Amplification of ERBB2, MYC, PPM1D and ZNF217 was detected rarely (1-2% of tumors) indicating a considerably lower amplification frequency than in FBC. CCND1 amplification was observed in 12% of cases, being in good concordance with findings from FBC. In addition, CCND1 overexpression was detected in 63% of tumors and was associated with ER positivity (p < 0.0001). Our results indicate distinct differences in the genetic basis of MBC and FBC and suggest that marked differences exist in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The lack of ERBB2 involvement was especially unexpected and implies that ERBB2-targeted therapies are unlikely to be beneficial in MBC. Furthermore, the high frequency of hormone receptor positivity and the association between ER positivity and CCND1 overexpression supports the notion that hormonal regulation is likely to be essential for the development of MBC.

J	BCI:BCI200400468578	15280636			Alcohol drinking may increase risk of breast cancer in men: a European population-based case-control study		Guenel, Pascal (guenel@vjf.inserm.fr) ; Cyr, Diane; Sabroe, Svend; Lynge, Elsebeth; Merletti, Franco; Ahrens, Wolfgang; Baumgardt-Elms, Cornelia; Menegoz, Francois; Olsson, Hakan; Paulsen, Stein; Simonato, Lorenzo; Wingren, Gun									Cancer Causes & Control		2004	August 2004	15	6	571-580	571	580							Objective: It has been estimated that alcohol drinking increases the risk of breast cancer in women by approximately 7% for each increment of 10 g alcohol per day. However, the few studies conducted on breast cancer among men have failed to detect an association with quantitative measures of alcohol drinking, even if the alcohol intake is generally higher in men than in women. On the other hand, increased risks of male breast cancer were inconsistently reported in alcoholics or patients with liver cirrhosis. We have investigated the role of alcohol drinking in male breast cancer using data collected in a population-based case-control study on seven rare cancers, conducted in Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden. Methods: The cases were 74 histologically verified male breast cancer patients aged 35-70 years. The controls (n = 1432) selected from population registers, and frequency-matched to the cases by age group and geographic area. To check for consistency, a separate analysis was conducted using as controls the patients with a rare cancer other than the breast recruited simultaneously in the European study (n = 519 men). Results: Based on population controls, the risk of developing breast cancer in men increased by 16% (95% CI: 7-26%) per 10, g alcohol/day (p 0.001). An odds ratio of 5.89 (95% CI: 2.21-15.69) was observed for alcohol intake greater than 90 g per day, as compared with light consumers ( 15 g per day). Similar associations were observed when other rare cancers patients were used as controls. Conclusion: We found that the relative risk of breast cancer in men is comparable to that in women for alcohol intakes below 60 g per day. It continues to increase at high consumption levels not usually studied in women.

It represents a biologically heterogeneous disorder, and its clinical course may vary from indolent and slowly progressive to rapidly metastatic disease. Most of our current knowledge regarding its biology, natural history, and treatment strategies has been extrapolated from its female counterpart. Information regarding prognostic relevance of new molecular markers is limited. At the European Institute of Oncology we performed a study showing data in which p21Waf1 and p27Kip1 proteins were evaluated in a series of male breast cancer patients. Our data suggest that the immunohistochemical evaluation of p21Waf1 and p27Kip1 expression in male breast carcinomas may be a further useful marker for selecting patients who express functional proteins that can be predictive for the most efficient endocrine response. Moreover, searching for more conservative treatment, we introduced in our clinical practice sentinel node biopsy, and if present, sentinel node biopsy of the internal mammary chain. The potential clinical implications of complete nodal staging are far-reaching, and give us a major new opportunity to stratify male patients with breast cancer for appropriate surgery as well as giving valuable prognostic information. Male breast cancer has biological differences compared with female breast cancer. It responds to hormonal manipulation and chemotherapy, but optimal treatment regimens in males are unknown. By analogy to the female breast cancer, post-mastectomy radiotherapy should be proposed in case of advanced T stage and/or lymph node positivity (considering the small volume of the male mammary gland, we suggest post-mastectomy irradiation in case of T >1 cm and/or presence of >1 metastatic axillary lymph node). Breast conserving surgery, performed in selected cases of male breast cancer, should be always followed by radiotherapy. Despite a wealth of small retrospective studies on MBC, its rarity means there is a lack of prospective randomized controlled treatment trials, which needs to be addressed if significant advances are to be made in the treatment of this unusual challenging disease.

Lymphoscintigraphy associated with gamma-probe guided surgery has been proved to reliably detect sentinel nodes in female patients with breast cancer. This study evaluates the feasibility of the surgical identification of sentinel node by using lymphoscintigraphy and a gamma-detecting probe in male patients, in order to select subjects who would be suitable for complete axillary lymphadenectomy. Methods Colloid human albumin labelled with 99Tc was administered to 18 male patients with breast cancer and clinically negative axillary lymph nodes. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed the day before surgery. An intraoperative gamma-detecting probe was used to identify sentinel nodes during surgery. Results Lymphoscintigraphy and biopsy of the sentinel node were successful in all cases. A total of 20 sentinel nodes were removed. Pathological examinations showed 11 infiltrating ductal carcinomas, two intraductal carcinomas and five intracystic papillary carcinomas. Six patients (33%) had positive sentinel node (micrometastases were found in three patients). These patients underwent axillary dissection; in five of them (83%) the sentinel node was the only positive node. Twelve patients (67%) showed negative sentinel nodes; in all of them no further surgical treatments were planned. Conclusions As in women, lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel node biopsy under the guidance of a gamma-detecting probe proved to be an easy method for the detection of sentinel nodes in male breast carcinoma. In male patients with early stage cancer, sentinel node biopsy might represent the standard surgical procedure in order to avoid unnecessary morbidity after surgery, preserving accurate staging of the disease in the axilla.

Syrjakoski, Kirsi; Kuukasjarvi, Tuula (tuula.kuukasjarvi@pshp.fi) ; Auvinen, Anssi; Kallioniemi, Olli-P.									International Journal of Cancer		2004	20 January, 2004	108	3	475-476	475	476							Genetic risk factors for male breast cancer (MBC) are poorly understood. High penetrance genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 account for only a small proportion of the disease. A 1100delC mutation in CHEK2 (previously known as CHK2), a cell-cycle checkpoint kinase, has been implicated in predisposition of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and breast cancer in families suggestive of LFS. This 1100delC mutation has also been shown to confer a 2-fold increase of breast cancer risk in women and a 10-fold increase of risk in men. It was estimated to account for 1% of breast cancers in women and as much as 9% of breast cancers in men at the population level based on analysis of breast cancer families without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. We wanted to evaluate the significance of CHEK2 1100delC in predisposition to MBC by assessing its frequency in a population-based material of 114 Finnish MBC patients. Two patients (1.8%) carried the 1100delC mutation. The mutation frequency among MBC cases was similar to that seen in population controls (26/1885, 1.4%). Our results indicate that CHEK2 1100delC variant does not substantially increase the risk of male breast cancer at the population level. We cannot exclude the fact that a small fraction of hereditary, family-positive male breast cancers could be attributable to CHEK2 mutations.

The defective development of AR-/- mammary glands involves the defects of insulin-like growth factor I-insulin-like growth factor I receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signals as well as estrogen receptor (ER) activity. Similar growth retardation and defects in growth factor-mediated Ras/Raf/MAPK cascade and ER signaling are also found in AR-/- MCF7 breast cancer cells. The restoration assays show that AR NH2-terminal/DNA-binding domain, but not the ligand-binding domain, is essential for normal MAPK function in MCF7 cells, and an AR mutant (R608K), found in male breast cancer, is associated with the excessive activation of MAPK. Together, our data provide the first in vivo evidence showing that AR-mediated MAPK and ER activation may play important roles for mammary gland development and MCF7 breast cancer cell proliferation.

We identified 60 mutations in BRCA1 and 53 in BRCA2. Of the 53 distinct mutations observed, 11 are novel and 12 have been reported only in Spanish families (41.5%). The prevalence of mutations in this set of families was 26.3%, but the percentage was higher in the families with breast and ovarian cancer (52.1%). The lowest proportion of mutations was found in the site-specific female breast cancer families (15.4%). Of the families with male breast cancer cases, 59.1% presented mutations in the BRCA2 gene. We found a higher frequency of ovarian cancer associated with mutations localized in the 5' end of the BRCA1 gene, but there was no association between the prevalence of this type of cancer and mutations situated in the ovarian cancer cluster region (OCCR) region of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene. The mutations 187-188delAG, 330A>G, 5236G>A, 5242C>A, and 589-590del (numbered after GenBank U14680) account for 46.6% of BRCA1 detected mutations whereas 3036-3039del, 6857-6858del, 9254-9258del, and 9538-9539del (numbered after GenBank U43746) account for 56.6% of the BRCA2 mutations. The BRCA1 330A>G has a Galician origin (northwest Spain), and BRCA2 6857-6858del and 9254-9258del probably originated in Catalonia (northeast Spain). Knowledge of the spectrum of mutations and their geographical distribution in Spain will allow a more effective detection strategy in countries with large Spanish populations.

Mutations in BRCA1 account for up to 40-50% of families with hereditary breast cancer only. Mutations in BRCA2 are linked to the other half of inherited breast cancer families and also to male breast cancer. On the contrary, no sporadic breast tumors have been shown to harbor mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. It seems that altered expressions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may contribute to breast cancer development. Moreover, BRCA1 and BRCA2 expressions are regulated in human breast cancer cell lines by estrogen. We addressed the issue of BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression in male breast cancers and gynecomastias. We investigated the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins in male breast specimens by immunohistochemical analysis with a panel of antibodies elicited against BRCA1 and BRCA2. The specificity of each antibody has been verified by Western blotting in cell lines from different origins. The characterization of 6 anti-BRCA1 antibodies revealed a BRCA1 220-kDa protein detected in breast cell lines (MDA-MB 231, HBL 100, T-47D and MCF7) or in an acute leukemia (MOLT 4), known to overexpress BRCA1. All 5 anti-BRCA2 antibodies detected a BRCA2 384-kDa protein in the HBL100 and MCF7 breast cell lines. By immunohistochemistry, we found nuclear, perinuclear, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi vesicle, secretion and apical cytoplasmic stainings in gynecomastias and sporadic and hereditary male breast cancers, for BRCA1 and BRCA2 protein expressions. We report an extensive expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins in different compartments of the mammary gland cells in male breast carcinomas and gynecomastias. This is consistent with the estrogen-dependent expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in human breast cells.														0250-7005

Annals of Internal Medicine		2002	15 October, 2002	137	8	678-687	678	687							Purpose: Breast cancer in men is uncommon; 1500 new cases are diagnosed in the United States yearly. Optimal management of breast cancer in men is unknown because the rarity of the disease precludes large randomized trials. A review of the literature was undertaken with emphasis on articles published over a 10-year period. Data Sources: Articles published between 1942 and 2000 on breast cancer in men were identified by using CancerLit, MEDLINE, and study bibliographies. Study Selection: All retrospective series and studies focusing on the epidemiology, risk factors, genetics, and pathology of breast cancer in men. Data Extraction: Data on the epidemiology, risk factors, genetics, pathology, molecular markers, prognostic factors, therapy, and outcomes of breast cancer in men. Data Synthesis: Carcinoma of the male breast accounts for 0.8% of all breast cancers. Risk factors include testicular disease, benign breast conditions, age, Jewish ancestry, family history, and the Klinefelter syndrome. BRCA2 mutations predispose man to breast cancer and may account for 4% to 14% of all cases. Pathology data were reviewed: 81% of tumors were estrogen receptor positive, 74% were progesterone receptor positive, 37% overexpressed c-erbB-2, 30% overexpressed p53, 79% overexpressed Bcl-2, 51% overexpressed cyclin D1, and 39% overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor. Prognostic factors include tumor size, histologic grade, and lymph node status; survival is similar to that of breast cancer in women when patients are matched for age and stage. Adjuvant hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, using the same guidelines as for women, are recommended for men. Hormonal therapy is the primary therapy for metastatic disease; chemotherapy should be reserved for hormone-refractory disease. Conclusion: Breast cancer is similar in men and women; however, breast cancer in men is more frequently hormone receptor positive and may be more sensitive to hormonal therapy.

Computed tomography of the chest revealed multiple pulmonary metastases. After administration of chemotherapy consisting of 5-fluorouracil (4000mg) and epirubicin (280mg), the pulmonary metastases disappeared and this was associated with a decrease of serum CEA levels and tumor size. Radical mastectomy and reconstruction for the chest wall defect using a deltopectoral flap (DP flap) were performed. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen showed intraductal adenocarcinoma with nodal metastases. The patient has remained well without clinical recurrence of distant metastasis for a follow-up period of two years. Our experience has demonstrated that the DP flap was a feasible approach in male breast reconstruction despite the debilitated condition of the patient.														0250-7005

The aim of this work was to analyze the different clinical and therapeutic features for this disease in men. Patients and methods: This was retrospective study including 12 cases of male breast cancer seen in the Dermatology department of Casablanca between 1988 and 1999. Results: The mean age of the patients was 60 years and the mean delay to consultation was 27 months. The skin was involved by tumor in 11 cases. Ulceration of the skin by tumor was seen in eight patients, and direct extension of the tumor into the nipple without ulceration was seen in three patients. Axillary lymph node involvement was seen in eight patients. Seven patients with invasive disease had metastases at distance. Treatment was usually surgical. Complementary treatment included radiotherapy, chemotherapy and/or hormonotherapy. Discussion: Although breast cancer in men is far less common than breast cancer in women, it is associated with less favorable prognosis because diagnosis is usually made at an advanced stage. Concerted efforts must be made to educate both the public and health professionals, in order to make earlier diagnosis and thereby improve prognosis.														0151-9638

CGH analysis demonstrated overrepresentation of 8q in all three cases. One case of gynecomastia presented gain of 1p34.3apprxpter, 11p14apprxq12, and 17p11.2apprxqter, and loss of 1q41apprxqter and 4q33apprxqter. The other gynecomastia presented del(1)(q41) as detected by both cytogenetic and CGH analysis. CGH analysis of the invasive ductal carcinoma confirmed a gain of 17p11.2apprxqter previously detected by cytogenetic analysis. These regions showed some similarity in their pattern of imbalance to the chromosomal alterations described in female and male breast cancer.

Its genetic basis has received little attention. Allelic imbalance, reflected by change in microsatellite repeat number (MSI) or loss of heterozygosity (LOH), is thought to play an important role in carcinogenesis. In this study we have examined DNA extracted from paraffin tissue from 15 patients treated for male breast cancer, for evidence of such abnormalities, at 20 different loci across the genome. Polymerase chain reaction amplified products of normal and tumor DNA pairs were compared by electrophoresis on Spreadex gels. MSI was detected in 5 patients; at a single site in 2 cases and at 3, 7 and 9 sites in another 3 cases. LOH was seen in 8 cases (53%); at more than one site in 4 of these. Two patients had allelic variation at 56 and 62% of assessable sites. The most unstable loci were D2S441 (33%) and D13S325 (27%). These observations indicate that replication errors and allelic loss characterise male breast cancer tissue in much the same way as they do in women. More studies will be needed to establish whether these are random lesions or whether there are specifically affected sites that occur in both male and female breast cancer.														1021-335X

Journal of Medical Genetics		2001	March, 2001	38	3	159-164	159	164							Cowden syndrome (CS) (OMIM 158350) is a multiple hamartoma syndrome associated with germline mutations in the PTEN tumour suppressor gene. While CS is characterised most commonly by non-cancerous lesions (mucocutaneous trichilemmomas, acral and palmoplantar keratoses, and papillomatous papules), it is also associated with an increased susceptibility to breast cancer (in females) and thyroid cancer, as well as non-cancerous conditions of the breast and thyroid. Here we report two cases of male breast cancer occurring in patients with classical CS phenotypes and germline PTEN mutations. The first subject was diagnosed with CS indicated primarily by mucocutaneous papillomatosis, facial trichilemmomas, and macrocephaly with frontal bossing at the age of 31 years. He developed breast cancer at 41 years and subsequently died of the disease. A PTEN mutation, c.802delG, was identified in this subject, yet none of his family members showed evidence of a CS phenotype, suggesting that this PTEN mutation may be a de novo occurrence. The second subject had a CS phenotype including multiple trichilemmomas and thyroid adenoma, developed male breast cancer at 43 years, and died of the disease at 57 years. He was a carrier of a PTEN mutation c.347-351delACAAT that cosegregated with the CS phenotype in affected family members. These two cases of male breast cancer associated with germline PTEN mutations and the CS phenotype suggest that CS may be associated with an increased risk of early onset male as well as female breast cancer.

Data on a broad range of previously suggested risk factors were collected in a set of Scandinavian breast cancer cases and matched controls. Incident cases (n=282) with histologically verified carcinomas of the breast were identified from notification to the cancer registries of Denmark, Norway and Sweden over a 4-year period 1987-1991 and of these cases, 156 men could be approached and responded. Controls were identified through national central population registers and were matched individually for country, sex and year of birth. Controls with a diagnosis of breast cancer were excluded; 468 of 780 controls responded. Data on risk factors were collected by self-administered questionnaires mailed to the cases between land 2 years after diagnosis and to controls during the same period. The findings were compatible with an increased risk associated with family history of breast cancer (odds ratio (OR)=3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-5.6), obesity 10 years before diagnosis (OR=2.1, 95% CI 1.0-4.5) for BMI>30, diabetes (OR=2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.3) and the use of digoxin and methyldopa (OR=2.0 and 2.1, respectively). The association with family history of breast cancer has been repeated in several studies, while the relation to anthropometric measures has been equivocal. We could not substantiate some associations seen in other studies; namely those with high education, fertility, marital status, testicular injury, liver disease and religion. The detailed questions about gynaecomastia indicated that many cases reported signs of breast cancer as a gynaecomastia. This type of misunderstanding may explain the strong association with gynaecomastia seen in other studies. Several patients died before contact. Thus, risk factors related to a more aggressive male breast cancer or related to high risk of dying (e.g. liver cirrhosis, heavy smoking) may have been missed.														0284-186X		10.1080/028418601750288181

The disease often presented in aged patients (median-66 years) and as advanced stage (stage III/IV-51%). Excluding stage IV disease, the neoplasia were predominantly ductal invasive carcinomas, NOS (not otherwise specified) (92%), grade 1 and grade 2 (94%), positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors (72% and 74%), negative for androgen receptors (100%), p53 negative (95%), c-erbB-2 negative (88%) and DNA aneuploid (73%). Assessment of disease outcome is determined by stage at time of diagnosis, and axillary lymph node status was the only parameter found to have a statistically significant correlation with either disease-free interval or overall survival (p<0.001) by multivariate analysis. Clinically useful information on the probability of relapse can be added by determining c-erbB-2 (p=0.02) and progesterone receptors (p=0.04) in stage III and tumor ploidy (p=0.04) in pN1 subgroups of patients.

He had a blackish swollen right nipple with bloody discharge that lasted for 8 months. Histopathology of the lesion disclosed intraepidermal and dermal atypical cells forming small clusters and underlying intraductal carcinoma. Melanocytes were dispersed in the epidermis. Dermal melanophages were also detected. The atypical cells were positive for carcinoembryonic antigen, human-milk fat globule protein and a recently described new antigen, RCAS-1, but negative for S-100 or HMB-45. We diagnosed this case as Paget's disease of the male breast. Paget's disease of the breast is usually nonpigmented and occurs almost exclusively in women. Pigmented Paget's disease of the male breast is extremely rare, and only a few cases have been reported. Albeit rare, pigmented Paget's disease has to be included in the differential diagnosis of pigmented lesions of the nipple.														1018-8665		10.1159/000051614

Data from six in-depth interviews with men who had breast cancer identified seven major issues. These were associated with delay in diagnosis, shock, stigma, body image, causal factors, the provision of information and emotional support. The findings from this small study suggest that there are psychological and social factors for men diagnosed with breast cancer which have implications for their care and management. The recommendations arising from this study are the development of a structured education programme aimed at all primary health-care professionals; with availability of pre and postoperative gender-specific information to alleviate the potential psychological problems associated with the diagnosis; and provision of appropriate support/counselling services for partners of patients.

We genotyped 31 Jewish Israeli males with breast cancer for the predominant Jewish BRCA1 (185delAG, 5382InsC) and BRCA2 (6174delT) germline mutations: 11 individuals from high-risk families and 20 patients unselected for family history of cancer. Two patients of the high-risk group (18.2%) displayed germline mutations: one harbored the 185delAG BRCA1 mutation, and the other the 6174delT mutation in BRCA2. None of the unselected patients displayed any mutation. In 2 patients, complete mutation analysis of the BRCA2 gene did not reveal any disease-associated mutations.

Patients and Methods: Fifty patients (mean age, 62.2 years) with invasive ductal carcinoma were retrospectively studied. All patients received surgery; 35 had adjuvant postoperative therapy. The median follow-up was 59 months (range, 1 to 230 months). c-myc, c-erbB-2, p53, and bcl-2 proteins were immunohistochemically detected on sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues using 9E11, CB11, DO7, and bcl-2 124 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors were detected using specific mAbs. Cell proliferation was assessed by MIB-1 mAb. Results: In univariate analysis, c-myc, c-erbB-2, and p53 protein overexpression was significantly correlated with prognosis. The median survival was 107 months for c-myc-negative and 52 months for c-myc-positive patients (P = .01), 96 months for c-erbB-2-negative and 39 months for c-erbB-2-positive patients (P = .02), and 100 months for p53-negative and 33 months for p53-positive patients (P = .0008). Tumor histologic grade (P = .01), tumor size (P = .02), patient age at diagnosis (P = .03), and MIB-1 scores (P = .0004) also had prognostic value. In multivariate analysis, only c-erbB-2 and p53 immunoreactivity retained independent prognostic significance. All nine patients who did not express c-erbB-2 and p53 proteins were alive after 58 months, whereas none of the 14 patients expressing both proteins survived at 61 months follow-up (P = .0002). Conclusion: Overexpression of c-myc, c-erbB-2, and p53 proteins may be regarded as an additional prognostic factor in MBC. The combination of c-erbB-2 and p53 immunoreactivity can stratify patients into different risk groups.														0732-183X		10.1200/JCO.2000.18.16.2948

All four tumors were near-diploid, and except for the primary tumor from the right breast, had a 45,X,-Y clone in common. The loss of the Y chromosome was, however, common to all four tumors, whereas metaphase cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes showed a normal 46,XY chromosome complement. The primary tumor from the right breast was monoclonal, with loss of the Y chromosome and gain of 1q, whereas its metastasis had two related clones: the 45,X,-Y clone, and the other a more complex version of the clone in the primary tumor, with inv(3), -14, and del(16)(q13) as additional changes. The primary tumor from the left breast was polyclonal with three unrelated clones: 45,X,-Y/45,XY,-18/47,XY,+20, two of which were present in its metastasis. DNA flow cytometric studies showed diploidy for both primary tumors. No mutation in the BRCA2 gene was found on analysis of DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes. The present findings show that del(16)(q13) is a recurrent finding among male breast carcinomas and that some of the primary cytogenetic abnormalities, as well as the pattern of chromosomal changes during the progression of sporadic breast carcinoma in the male, are similar to those in the female. In addition, the loss of the Y chromosome in the tumors but not in peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggests a possible role for this abnormality in the pathogenesis of male breast carcinoma.

European Journal of Cancer		1999	Aug., 1999	35	8	1248-1257	1248	1257							We investigated cancer incidence between 1958 and 1995 in 1873 individuals belonging to 29 consecutively identified BRCA1 and 20 BRCA2 associated families from Southern Sweden using data from parish and local tax authorities, as well as the Swedish Cancer Registry, Cause of Death Registry and Census Registry. 150 malignant tumours were analysed from 1145 relatives in the BRCA1 families and 87 tumours were analysed from 728 relatives in the BRCA2 families. After excluding index cases which led to the mutation analysis, the incidence for all malignant tumours was significantly increased for both BRCA1- standardised morbidity rate, SMR, 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59-2.45; P < 0.0001 and BRCA2- (SMR 1.79, 95% CI 1.35-2.31; P < 0.0001) associated family members. For women in BRCA1-associated families, the incidence of breast cancer (SMR 3.76, 95% CI 2.29-5.80, P < 0.0001), ovarian cancer (SMR 15.49, 95% CI 9.46-23.92, P < 0.0001), stomach cancer (SMR 5.86, 95% CI 1.60-15.01, P= 0.005) were significantly increased. Amongst men only invasive squamous cell cancer of the skin was significantly increased (SMR 6.02, 95% CI 1.96-14.05, P = 0.002). In BRCA2 associated families, female breast cancer (SMR 3.03, 95% CI 1.61-5.18, P = 0.0005) was increased after exclusion of index cases. If these were included, ovarian cancer (SMR 5.16, 95% CI 1.89-11.24, P = 0.001), invasive cervical cancer (SMR 4.21, 95% CI 1.15-10.79, P = 0.016), male breast cancer (SMR 290.52, 95% CI 125.42-572.43, P < 0.0001), and prostate cancer (SMR 2.21, 95% CI 0.89-4.56, P = 0.042) were significantly increased. The increased risk for ovarian cancer in BRCA2 related families were limited to the cases leading to mutation analysis. Our data suggest that apart from breast and ovarian cancer, the incidence of other cancer types do not appear to be greatly increased in BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated families and does not warrant specific clinical follow-up in carriers.														0959-8049		10.1016/S0959-8049(99)00135-5

Onkologie		1999	Aug., 1999	22	4	304-307	304	307							Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease. This study reports the results of a treatment including radiotherapy of a single institution. Material and Methods: The hospital charts of 23 patients with nonmetastatic MBC treated from 1971 to 1991 were reviewed. The tumor was located centrally or medially in 10 patients. Tumor classification: Tis C3 n = 1, pT1 n = 2, pT2 n = 8, T2 C3 n = 1, pT3 n=4, pT4 n=6, unknown n=1, cN0 n=8, cN+ n=1, pN0 n = 5, pN+ n = 9. Biopsy only was performed in 2 patients, tumorectomy in 2 patients and radical or modified radical mastectomy in 19 patients. Radiotherapy was given to the chest wall (median total dose 46 Gy) in all patients but two (who had only irradiation of the nodes) and to the axiliary/supraclavicular nodes (median total dose 48 Gy) in all patients but two (who had only chest wall irradiation). In 5 patients radiation of the mammaria interna nodes was added to the supraclavicular field (median total dose 48 Gy). 5 patients with known receptor status were treated with adjuvant hormone therapy. Median follow-up was 62 (6-182) months. Results: 19 patients died, 15 with tumor. The median overall survival time was 63 months, the disease-specific 5-year and 10-year survival rate was 69% and 35%, respectively. There were 3 chest wall relapses in one of two nonirradiated patients and in one of two only irradiated patients, respectively. Distant metastases occurred in 12 patients. Conclusion: This study supports adjuvant radiotherapy for treatment of advanced male breast cancer.														0378-584X

European Journal of Cancer		1999	May, 1999	35	5	707-710	707	710							Since the identification of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, mutation analyses have been carried out in different populations. Here we screened 15 Turkish breast and breast-ovarian cancer families for mutations in both genes by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) and the protein truncation test (PTT), followed by DNA sequencing. Three families included a male breast cancer case, one without family history. Three germline mutations were identified, two in BRCA1 and one in BRCA2. The two BRCA1 mutations, 5382insC and 5622C fwdarw T, were found in breast-ovarian cancer families. The BRCA2 3414delTCAG is a novel mutation detected in a site-specific breast cancer family that included 1 case of male breast cancer. These first results of Turkish families show that the frequency of germline BRCA1 or BRAC2 mutations appears to be high in families with at least 3 breast and/or ovarian cancer cases.														0959-8049		10.1016/S0959-8049(99)00014-3

Although no germ-line BRCA1 mutation was observed, 6 of the 18 male breast cancer cases (33%) carried truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Unexpectedly, none of them reported a family history for breast/ ovarian cancer. Four of six truncating mutations were novel, and two mutations were recurrent. Four patients (22%) had a family history of breast/ovarian cancer in at least one first- or second-degree relative; however, no BRCA2 mutation was identified among them. No mutation was identified in either of the genes in the gynecomastias. These results provide evidence for a strong genetic component of male breast cancer in Hungary.

Occupational and Environmental Medicine		1998	Sept., 1998	55	9	599-604	599	604							Objective-To investigate whether risk of male breast cancer is associated with workplace exposures. Methods-A case-control study of 178 cases of male breast cancer and 1041 controls was carried out with data from the United States national mortality followback survey, which collected questionnaire information from proxy respondents of a 1% sample of all 1986 United States deaths among subjects aged 25-74 years. Occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields, high temperatures, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), herbicides, other pesticides, and organic solvents was assessed by applying job-exposure matrices, based on the 1980 United States census occupation and industry codes, to the longest job held by study subjects as reported by the informants. A socioeconomic status index was created by combining information on annual family income, education, assets, and occupation to assess the association of socioeconomic status with male breast cancer. Relative risks were derived from logistic regression modelling, which included age, socioeconomic status, marital status, and body mass index, as well as occupational exposures. Results-Risk of male breast cancer increased significantly with increasing socioeconomic status index (test for trend: p < 0.01), but the risks associated with individual socioeconomic status variables were smaller and the trends were not significant. A significant increase in risk of male breast cancer was associated with employment in blast furnaces, steel works, and rolling mills (odds ratio (OR) 3.4; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1 to 10.1, based on six cases), and motor vehicle manufacturing (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.2 to 8.2, based on seven cases). However, exposures to electromagnetic fields, high temperature, PAHs, herbicides, other pesticides, and organic solvents were not associated with risk of male breast cancer. Conclusions-The role of workplace exposures in increasing risk of breast cancer among men employed in motor vehicle manufacturing and in blast furnaces, steel works, and rolling mills deserves further investigation. The finding on socioeconomic status suggests that, as well as reproductive factors, other lifestyle factors such as diet that may be related to high socioeconomic status in men should be investigated further.														1351-0711		10.1136/oem.55.9.599

He complained of abdominal pain due to a progress of aortic dissection in preparation for the radical operation for breast cancer. Blood pressure was initially controlled and he was administered a simple mastectomy under local anesthesia. One month after the first operation, a radical operation for breast cancer was successfully performed. The tumor was in stage II, and two years after the operation, the patient remained free of recurrent disease.

Co; Fraumeni, Joseph F., Jr.									Cancer Causes and Control		1998	May, 1998	9	3	269-275	269	275							Objectives: The etiology of male breast cancer is obscure, although an excess risk has been associated with Klinefelter syndrome, testicular disorders, benign breast disease including gynecomastia, use of exogenous estrogens, radiation, and a family history of male or female breast cancer. We conducted a case-control study to investigate risk factors further for breast cancer in men. Methods: Based on data from the 1986 National (United States) Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS) of almost 20,000 deceased adults (age 25 years or over), we compared information obtained from next-of-kin interviews of 178 men who died of breast cancer with that of 512 male controls who died of other causes. Information was obtained on selected demographic and other factors, including diet, exercise, occupation, height and weight, and use of tobacco and alcohol. Results: Increased risks were found for men who were described by their next-of-kin as very overweight (odds ratio (OR) = 2.3, 95 percent confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-5.0). The risks associated with the three upper quartiles of body mass index (BMI) (wt/ht) were 1.3, 1.6, and 2.3, respectively, with a significant dose-response relationship (P < 0.01). An excess risk was also associated with limited exercise (OR = 1.3, CI = 0.8-2.0). Consumption of red meat was associated with an increased risk, and consumption of fruits and vegetables with a decreased risk, although the trends were not significant. No association was found for tobacco or alcohol use, but an excess risk was associated with higher levels of socioeconomic status (SES) (OR = 1.8, CI = 1.1-3.0). Conclusions: Our study suggests that obesity increases the risk of male breast cancer, possibly through hormonal mechanisms, while dietary factors, physical activity, and SES indicators also deserve further investigation.														0957-5243		10.1023/A:1008869003012

Onkologie		1998	April, 1998	21	2	160-166	160	166							Male breast cancer represents 1% of all cancers in men. Increased age and advanced stage at the time of diagnosis as well as a high percentage of estrogen receptor-containing hormone-sensitive tumors represent specific features. In primary male breast cancer modified radical mastectomy proved to be the standard surgical approach. In case of circumscript invasion of underlying muscles, additional local excision may be sufficient. In tumors presenting with extensive invasion, a combined modality approach (preoperative chemotherapy, toilet mastectomy, chest wall irradiation) should be used preferably to traditional radical mastectomy. Local failure rate can be reduced by postoperative irradiation and can be advocated after removal of locally advanced tumors, especially in case of concomitant infiltration of dermis and/or chest wall or in case of increased number of involved axillary lymph nodes. Tumorectomy with axillary dissection and postoperative radiotherapy may be applied in selected cases of very small tumors without nipple involvement. Systemic adjuvant therapy is advisable in the presence of involved axillary lymph nodes; tamoxifen for receptor-positive patients and combination chemotherapy for receptor-negative patients should be given. Application in stage I patients should be individualized, following the guidelines of the consensus conference, St. Gallen 1995. First-line hormonal therapy for metastatic disease is tamoxifen for estrogen receptor-positive patients followed by LH-RH analogs + antiandrogens, progestins, orchidectomy, or aminoglutethimide. The validity of selective aromatase inhibitors remains to be clarified, their use in male breast cancer should be considered. Receptor-negative tumors and those rapidly progressing should be treated with combination chemotherapy. This is also true for primary or secondary failures after hormonal treatment. Receptor-positive but aggressive metastatic disease can be treated by combined chemo-hormone therapy.														0378-584X		10.1159/000026799

However, among independently ascertained families with the same mutation, cases of male breast cancer often appear to cluster in a single family or in a particular branch of one family. This suggests that the risk of male breast cancer conferred by BRCA2 mutations may be modified by other genetic or environmental factors. We report a family in which three brothers with breast cancer carry in their germ line two genetic abnormalities: an insertion A at nucleotide 2041 in exon 10 of BRCA2, which leads to premature termination of the encoded protein at codon 615, and a tandem interstitial duplication involving chromosome bands 9p23-24. We propose that the coexistence of this rare chromosomal abnormality with BRCA2 mutation may be augmenting the risk of male breast cancer conferred by the BRCA2 mutation.														0008-5472

(1993) found significant evidence for elevated incidence of breast and ovarian cancers among female first-degree relatives of men with breast cancer. Using an extension of logistic regressive models we investigate whether, after allowing for multifactorial familial correlations, single locus segregation could be the cause of the elevated incidence in these families. The logit for a given sib in the class D logistic regressive model depends on the order in which affected sibs occur in a sibship. That makes the model less appropriate for the situation where a polygenic component or a common sibling environment may be present, as well as being computationally cumbersome. In this paper, we propose to use the proportion of siblings in a sibship who are affected to quantify a sibling correlation. That not only relaxes the interchangeability problem but also makes the model computationally efficient. We then use this modified class D logistic regressive model for our segregation analysis. Using the proportion of siblings in a sibship who are affected as a covariate resulted in a significantly higher likelihoods in all the models we investigated. We found evidence for a dominant Mendelian gene leading to early age of onset of breast and/or ovarian cancer. This could either be a germline mutation of BRCA2 or a mutation in a gene different from BRCA2.

In this review, the association of HER-2/neu gene and protein abnormalities studied by Southern and slot blotting, immunohistochemistry, enzyme immunoassays, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with prognosis in breast cancer is studied in depth by review of a series of 47 published studies encompassing more than 15,000 patients. The relative advantages of gene amplification assays and frozen/fresh tissue immunohistochemistry over paraffin section immunohistochemistry are discussed. The significance of HER-2/neu overexpression in ductal carcinoma in situ and the HER-2/neu status in uncommon female breast conditions and male breast cancer are also considered. The potential value of HER-2/neu status for the prediction of response to therapy in breast cancer is presented in the light of a series of recently published studies showing a range of impact on the outcome of patients treated with hormonal, cytotoxic, and radiation therapies. The evidence that HER-2/neu gene and protein abnormalities in breast cancer predict resistance to tamoxifen therapy and relative sensitivity to chemotherapy regimens including adriamycin is presented. The review will also evaluate the status of serum-based testing for circulating the HER-2/neu receptor protein and its ability to predict disease outcome and therapy response. In the final section, the review will briefly present preliminary data concerning the use of antibody-based therapies directed against the HER-2/neu protein and their potential to become a new modality for breast cancer treatment. The recently presented phase III clinical trial evidence that systemic administration of anti-HER2 antibodies (Herceptin), alone and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with HER-2/neu overexpressing primary tumors, can increase the time to recurrence and overall response rates in metastatic breast cancer is reviewed.														1066-5099		10.1002/stem.160413

J	BCI:BCI19684900088592				Estradiol metabolism in cirrhosis		ZUMOFF; FISHMAN, JACK; GALLAGHER, T. F.; HELLMAN, LEON									J CLIN INVEST		1968		47	(1)	20-25	20	25							Abnormal estrogen metabolism has been found in cirrhosis after administration of intravenous tracers of estradiol-3H to 6 patients and 23 healthy controls. The major abnormalities observed involved estrogen metabolities other than the 3 "classic" ones, i. e., estrone (El), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3). Urinary recovery of radioactivity was regularly elevated in the patients, to an average of 71% of the dose compared to 51% in normals. This is considered to reflect the component of intrahepatic cholestasis in cirrhosis. The per cent dose recovered as urinary glucosiduronates (42%) was normal in cirrhotics in contrast to impaired glucuronidation of cortisol metabolites in this disease. El and E2 were present in normal amounts, and E3 was slightly elevated to 21% of the extract compared to 14% in controls. There were strikingly decreased excretion of 2-hydroxyestrone (3% compared with normal 2O%) and 2-methoxyestrone (2% compared with 5%) and increased excretion of 16a-hydroxyestrone (12% compared with normal 6%). Thus cirrhosis, too, is characterized by the reciprocal relationship between decreased 2-hydroxylation and increased 16a-hydroxylation previously described in hypothyroidism and male breast cancer. However, unlike these latter, the increase of 16[alpha]-hydroxy metabolites was less than the decrease of 2-hydroxy metabolites. The data indicate clearcut impairment of 2-hydroxylation, suggestive impairment of 16a-hydroxylation, and a definite depression of the reaction 16[alpha]-hydroxyestrone [long dash]estriol, the latter finding so far unique to cirrhosis. Demonstration of abnormal peripheral metabolism of estrogen in cirrhosis provides a new approach to the origin of the hyperestrogenic syndrome in this disease. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																																		
J	BCI:BCI19674800071098	6020792			Demographic, clinical and survivorship characteristics of males with primary cancer of the breast		KELLER, ANDREW Z.									AMER J EPIDEMIOL		1967		85	(2)	183-199	183	199							A study of all males diagnosed and treated for primary histologically confirmed adeno-carcinoma of the breast, reported by all US Veterans Administration hospitals from 1958 through 1963 is presented. Cases are compared with 2 groups of control subjects selected from a numerical sequence of patients either in all diagnostic categories or with urinary-bladder or kidney cancer, and with the living population of veterans, a one-day 35% census of medical and surgical patients in these hospitals, and a 1% sample of Veterans Administration hospital discharges. Male breast cancer was not associated with marital status, religion, race, occupation, geography, selected systemic diseases or reported use of tobacco. Rates of breast-cancer incidence and prevalence increased with age but the relative mortality experiences decreased with age. The average death rate for breast-cancer cases with generalized metastasis was 4 times greater than for other cases and 2 times greater than for US males of the cases' age and race. Early hospitalization and intensive follow-up were related to long periods ol patient survival and high rates of case prevalence. Male breast cancer when both localized and treated did not reduce patient survival, but when metastasized beyond axillary nodes (although treated) significantly increased patient mortality. Rates of incidence, survival and prevalence for older males were higher than for young males with breast cancer. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: From auth. summ																10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a120682

A case report		TAKASHI, SUZUKI; KUBOTA, NOBUTAKA									ARCH SURG		1966		92	(6)	857-860	857	860							A case of Paget's disease of the male breast was reported. The incidence of Paget's disease in men appeared to be extremely low. Male breast cancer was not diagnosed at as early a stage in the disease as was female breast cancer. The cure rate therefore was not as favorable. It is of prime importance to realize the rarity of this disease; early diagnosis and early operation are mandatory. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																																		
J	BCI:BCI19654600048164	5220129			Cancer of the male breast		MOSS, N. HENRY									ANN N Y ACAD SCI		1964		114	(2)	937-950	937	950							Observations of 507 cases of male breast cancer reveal that cancer in the male occurs at a slightly later time in life than in the female breast. Malignancy of the male breast is unfortunately diagnosed in approximately 60 per cent of cases when the tumor is no longer localized. Delay, primarily by the patient, plays a major role in the stage of the cancer at diagnosis being regional or distant rather than localized. Further data must be accumulated to correlate the relationship of delay in diagnosis to ultimate survival. Educational efforts to the public to reduce this delay must continue, new adjunct diagnosis techniques in finding the cancer earlier must be developed to supplement the history and physical examination and aggressive efforts in our surgical therapy must be promoted. The five-year survival rate for all eligible cases is lower for males than for females and approximates 41 per cent. This difference in survival between male and female cannot be attributed to stage nor type of therapy and therefore the influence of endocrine factors or other biological influences must be determined to explain this difference. Radical rather than simple mastectomy yields superior five-year survival results. The data suggest that it is still the procedure of choice in the management of operable and resectable carcinomas of the male breast. However, variable factors in the selection of cases for simple mastectomy, as in female breast cancer, remains an unknown quantity and requires further study. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author

BRIT JOUR CANCER		1963		17	(4)	566-571	566	571							In the present breast cancer series covering material from the Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria, Egypt, during the period 1950-59, male cases formed 6.4% of the total against a maximum frequency of 1.3% found in other countries. Out of the eight traceable male cases, seven showed a history of or the presence of bilharzial infection, three further cases observed later. The high percentage of male breast cancer consistently observed in Egyptian figures is attributed to hyperoestrogenism secondary to bilharzial liver fibrosis. More work is being carried out on male cases of bilnarziasis, gynaecomastia and breast cancer to investigate their liver functions biochemically and by the mitochondrial activity of the hepatic cells. This evidence favors suggestions from earlier authors of hyperoestrogenism due to bilharziasis as a causal factor in male breast cancer, which shows a higher sex ratio in Egypt than elsewhere. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																10.1038/bjc.1963.75																		
J	BCI:BCI19644500038522	14072689			The epidemiology of breast cancer		LILIENFELD, ABRAHAM M.									CANCER RES		1963		23	(9 Pt. 1)	1503-1513	1503	1513							A review of available data on the epidemiology of breast cancer indicated the following: (a) a remarkable stability of the trend of mortality from female breast cancer in the United States since 1930; (b) Japan has the lowest death rate for female breast cancer, and Japan and Finland for male breast cancer, in the world; (c) the logarithm of the age-specific death rates from female breast cancer can be resolved into 2 linear components with the slope of the rates prior to 40-45 years of age being greater than the slope of those after 40-45 years of age; a similar change of slope, although to a lesser degree was observed for males. It was noted that for females this age group corresponded to the time of menopause; (d) female patients with breast cancer were more frequently never married or, when married, married at a later age than women in general. Since female breast cancer patients more often gave a history of having had artificial menopause and single women had had artificial menopause less frequently than married women, it was hypothesized that the single-married differences may reflect the differences in frequency of artificial menopause among single and married women; (e) the inverse relationship of frequency and length of nursing with female breast disease is far from being conclusive; (f) studies show that females with benign breast disease have an excess risk of developing breast cancer, but more definitive studies are needed; (g) studies show the existence of familial aggregation of breast cancer among both males and females; (h) a study of male breast cancer patients indicated that a larger proportion of them had a history of orchitis, orchiectomy, therapeutic x-ray exposure and benign breast disease. These data were interpreted as suggesting the influence of hormonal factors as being of importance in the etiology of breast cancer, but more definitive and precise studies are needed. A program of epidemiological research was outlined emphasizing the need for integrating laboratory investigations with the field epidemiological studies. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author
